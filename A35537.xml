      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>In this verſe <hi>Elihu</hi> enters his renewed ſuit againſt <hi>Job,</hi> or here he propoſeth what he had to charge <hi>Job</hi> with; <hi>Thinkeſt thou this to be right?</hi> And in the next or third verſe, he endeavours to make good this charge, or to prove that <hi>Job</hi> had ſaid ſo; <hi>for thou haſt ſaid,</hi> &amp;c.

There may be a threefold expoſition of theſe words:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, As an appeal to <hi>Jobs</hi> own breaſt; <hi>Thinkeſt thou this to be right?</hi> let me ask thee the queſtion, Haſt thou ſaid well in this? doſt thou believe thou haſt? let thy Conſcience judge, and make anſwer.

                  <p>Secondly, We may look upon the words, not only as an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, but as a reproof, or objurgation; <hi>Thinkeſt thou this to be right?</hi> What man in his right mind would think ſo! thou toldeſt thy wife in the ſecond Chapter, <hi>Thou ſpeakeſt like one of the fooliſh women;</hi> and may it not now be told thee, <hi>Thou ſpeakeſt like one of the fooliſh men?</hi> Would any man in his wits utter a word of this import, a word of ſo groſs a ſavour, of ſo dangerous a reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon the Juſtice of God, or ſo much as intimate himſelf by any the remoteſt conſequences, more juſt, more righteous than God? why hath ſuch a word dropt from thy mouth? Thus he chides, checks, and reproves him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Theſe words may have the ſenſe of a denying que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; <hi>Thinkeſt thou this to be right?</hi> Surely <hi>Job</hi> thou doſt not
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48335:6"/> think this to be right, I cannot believe that thou thinkeſt this to be right, thou are not ſurely ſo far left of Reaſon, and of Grace, as to think this to be right. This ſenſe gives ſome allay to, or abatement of the former; ſurely thou doſt not think ſo, though thou haſt ſpoken ſo; though thy words may have this meaning, yet I hope this is not thy meaning; I am unwilling to take up thy opinion from thy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; <hi>Thinkeſt thou this to be right?</hi> From the firſt Expoſition,</p>
                  <p>Note;
<q>It is a ſtrong way of conviction, to put or refer a matter to his Judgement and Conſcience, againſt whom we make oppoſition.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thinkeſt thou this to be right? I refer it to thy own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, whether this be right yea or no; and thus the Scripture ſpeaks often. When God would ſtop the mouth from all contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and not leave oppoſers a word to ſay, he leaves it upon them to ſay all. <hi>Moſes</hi> intending to prove that none could prevaile againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> unleſs (God provoked by ſin) delivered <hi>Iſrael</hi> up into their hands, gives this demonſtration of it (<hi>Deut.</hi> 32.31.) <hi>Their Rock is not as our Rock even our enemies themſelves being Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;</hi> I refer this to our enemies opinion, whether the Dunghil gods, the Idols whom they ſerve and truſt to, be like <hi>Jehovah,</hi> the living God, whom we have (and ought) to ſerve and truſt to. You that are our enemies, do you think your Rock is like our Rock? I know you do not. The Apoſtles, <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> referred it back to the judgment of their Judges, whether it were fit for them, to obey their commands, yea or no, when they called them, and charged them to preach no more in that name, the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, (<hi>Acts</hi> 4.19.) <hi>Whether it be right in the ſight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.</hi> We have received a command from God to preach<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Go teach all Nations</hi> (Math. 28.19.) and we have received a command from you not to preach; now we leave it with you, whether it be fit for us to obey God or you. So the Apoſtle having admoniſhed the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to flee from Idolatry, preſently adds (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.14, 15.) <hi>I ſpeak as to wiſe men, judge ye what I ſay;</hi> I have given you the rule, and I leave it to your conſideration, what's beſt and ſafeſt for you to do. <hi>I ſpeak as to wiſe men,</hi> that's a holy inſinuation; As if he had ſaid, <hi>I know you are wiſe men, men of underſtanding, and therefore I do not ſo much command you to obey what I ſay, as to judge what I ſay;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48335:6"/> I am much perſwaded you cannot judge otherwiſe in this thing than I do; There is ſo much truth and reaſon in what I ſay, that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but ſay ſo too.</hi> The ſame Apoſtle ſpeaks again in a like forme about womens praying uncovered; <hi>Judge in your ſelves, is it come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that a woman pray unto God uncovered</hi> (1 Cor. 11.13.) As if he had ſaid, <hi>I do not ſtand wholly to my own judgement in this caſe of conſcience, I dare refer it to you, and ſtand to yours.</hi> Thus in many things we may appeal unto the Conſciences of thoſe we deal with; &amp; no doubt the Conſcience is often ſatisfied while the Will ſtands out: Men of much underſtanding will diſpute, when Conſcience hath nothing to ſay; <hi>Yea ſome will for their own ends argue that to be right, which</hi> (in their Conſciences) <hi>they do not think to be ſo. Thinkeſt thou this to be right?</hi> Thou haſt ſaid it, but doſt thou think it? I trow not.</p>

                     <hi>Elihu</hi> doth not direct <hi>Job</hi> immediately to the Word, (though that's the authoritative and authentick Rule) but to his heart; thou haſt a Light in thy ſelf, whereby thou mayeſt ſee that this is not right. Thus the Apoſtle, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.14, 15.) <hi>Doth not even Nature it ſelf teach you, that if a man have long haire, it is a ſhame unto him? but if a woman have long haire, it is a glory to her, for her haire is given her for a covering.</hi> The Light which every man hath in him will ſhew this. Again, the Apoſtle (<hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14, 15.) proveth that the old Gentiles had a light of Nature in them, which ſhewed them many things amiſs. Thus he argueth; <hi>For when the Gentiles that have not the Law, do by nature the things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Law,</hi> (they do them by Nature, that is, by the Light of Nature, which ſhews them to do theſe things, that is, it ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them that they ought to be done, and they do them, as to the outward action, by that Light:) <hi>theſe having not the Law</hi> (that is, the written Word, publiſhed to them in that formality, which the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God have, <hi>theſe having not the Law) are a Law unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; which ſhew the work of the Law written in their hearts, their Conſcience alſo bearing witneſs, and their thoughts the mean while accuſing, or elſe excuſing one another.</hi> This Light ſhewed thoſe Gentiles ſo far what to do according to the Law, as left them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48335:7"/> excuſe, for not doing what it ſhewed. Goſpel Myſteries and matters of Faith are purely of Divine Revelation, but what the moral Law commands or forbids, the light of Nature leads us to do and to forbear.</p>
                  <p>There is a generation of people grown up and ſpreading amongſt us, who cry up <hi>the light within them,</hi> with neglect of, if not in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Theſe make a very ill uſe of this notion; For whoſoever bids us look to the light within us, to draw us off from the Word or light without us, erre greatly, and may quickly draw us into the greateſt errors both in Faith and Practiſe. 'Tis dangerous to go or act againſt the light within us, yet if we go or act alwayes by that light alone, we ſhall be in da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Natural light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Scripture-light, proves a falſe light, and may quickly lead us out of the way, and beſides our duty. Therefore the Prophet, when any ſhould ſay, <hi>Seek unto them that have familiar Spirits,</hi> &amp;c. doth not ſay, look to the light within you for reſolution, whether ye ſhould hearken to ſuch or no, but <hi>to the Law, and to the Teſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

Take heed of ſtriking and ſo ſplitting againſt that Rock; yet certainly there is a light within us that muſt not be reſiſted. The Apoſtle reports <hi>that</hi> as the ſin of the old Gentiles (<hi>Rom.</hi> 1.28.) <hi>They did not like to retain God in their knowledge;</hi> they had a light of God by nature, God was in their knowledge, but they liked not to think of God, but rather thought of the world, and of any vanity, than of God, rather of the creature, than of the Creator; for this cauſe God gave them up <hi>to a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate mind,</hi>

By which negative expreſſion, <hi>Not convenient,</hi> he poſitively intends the vileſt evils and debaucheries of Nature, not to be named.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48335:7"/> And if God were ſo wroth with the <hi>Gentiles</hi> for not anſwering the common Light of Nature, no marvel if he ſpake ſo dreadfully againſt thoſe that refuſe and oppoſe the Light of the moſt glorious Goſpel (<hi>John</hi> 3.19.) <hi>This is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkneſſe rather than light, becauſe their deeds were evil.</hi> Not to anſwer the Light of Conſcience with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us rightly informed, much more not to obey the Light of the Goſpel without us, leaves us under condemnation. The Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in man will ſhew him very much what he ought to do, and judge him for not doing it. <hi>Thinkeſt thou this to be right?</hi> Doth the Principle planted in thee comply with this Poſition?</p>
                  <p>But what was it that <hi>Elihu</hi> puts the Queſtion about? You have it in the cloſe of the verſe;
<q>That thou ſaidſt, My righteouſneſſe is more than Gods;</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or according to the ſtrictneſſe of the Hebrew, <hi>My righteouſneſs is before Gods.</hi> The Prepoſition here uſed is often taken compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, and hath the ſame ſignification with that (<hi>Math.</hi> 11.19.) where Chriſt ſaith (as we tranſlate) <hi>Wiſdome is juſtified of her Children;</hi> that is, Chriſt, or the Doctrine of the Goſpel, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Light that ſhines there, is juſtified, that is approved and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared juſt, by all who are her Children indeed, <hi>born not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</hi> This is a good and profitable ſence. Though ſtrangers do not, will not juſtifie Wiſdome, yet her Children do and will. Nevertheleſſe that comparative tranſlation, and reading, which ſome contend for, carrieth in it a clear truth alſo, and ſerves to illuſtrate this Text in <hi>Job,</hi> now under-hand. <hi>Wiſdome is juſtified more than her children, or rather than her children, or before her children.</hi> That is, more, rather, and before the Scribes and Phariſees, who pretended high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they were the children, yea the chief, if not the only chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Wiſdome; and while they made this boaſt, they really re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted and oppoſed Jeſus Chriſt, who is wiſdome, and in whom are hid all the treaſures of wiſdome: And therefore how much ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Scribes and Phariſees flattered themſelves in their own opinion, or were applauded, and preferred by others, as children of wiſdome, or as very wiſe men; yet Jeſus Chriſt the true Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, was juſtified by God, and all good men, more than they, or before, yea infinitely before them; he was juſtified fully, but they
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48335:8"/> not at all. Such a negative ſence Chriſt intends, in that comparative determination, between the Publican and the Phariſee (Luke 18.14.) <hi>I tell you, this man went down to his houſe juſtified rather than the other:</hi> That is, the Publican went home juſtified rather, or righteous rather, or more righteous than the Phariſee; the proud Phariſee, not being at all juſtified, nor righteous, but in his own eyes. Some Comparatives imply a perfect Negative to the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite party, others only a partial. Such a comparative ſence <hi>Elihu</hi> intimates in <hi>Jobs</hi> aſſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Therefore Secondly, I anſwer, that although <hi>Job</hi> had not ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken this in ſo many words, or ſyllabically, yet he had ſpoken that from which <hi>Elihu</hi> might gather ſuch a ſence, or of which he might make ſuch an interpretation.

                  <p>
                     <hi>But what righteouſneſſe is here meant?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, There is a twofold righteouſneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, There is the righteouſneſſe of our perſons, which is either imputed in juſtification, or imparted in ſanctification, (as hath been ſhewed upon ſome other paſſages of <hi>Elihu's</hi> diſcourſe with <hi>Job</hi>) This is the righteouſneſſe of our perſons; as juſtified we are righteous, as ſanctified we are alſo righteous. Now when <hi>Elihu</hi> chargeth <hi>Job</hi> to ſay that his righteouſneſſe was more than Gods, we are not to underſtand it as if he had ſaid, his perſonal righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48335:8"/> in either notion, was more than Gods; for that righteouſneſs which is imputed to our perſons, is indeed the righteouſneſs of God, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3.) but 'tis not a righteouſneſſe more than Gods. And as for that righteouſneſſe planted in our perſons, how imperfect and mixt with corruption is that, at beſt, in this life? And therefore had <hi>Job</hi> ſpoken any ſuch words, or had harboured ſuch a thought, it had been blaſphemy at the higheſt rate; and (as one expreſſeth it well) <hi>If Job had ſpoken theſe horrible blaſphemies,</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, There is a righteouſneſſe of our Cauſe, or of the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial matter in controverſie: In which ſence (I conceive) <hi>Judah</hi> ſaid of <hi>Tamar,</hi> (Gen. 38.26.) <hi>She hath been more righteous than I.</hi> That is, She hath carried this buſineſſe better, and more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to right. And thus we may underſtand <hi>Elihu</hi> charging <hi>Job</hi> for ſaying, <hi>My righteouſneſſe is more than Gods;</hi> that is, my Cauſe is more righteous than his; and to ſay that (which is the moſt moderate ſence) was too great a boldneſſe for any creature, yea a blaſphemy againſt the Creator. Shall man preſume to ſay that God doth not carry things righteouſly with him, or that there is no reaſon why God ſhould deal ſo or ſo with him! But did <hi>Job</hi> ever affirm his Cauſe more righteous than Gods? I anſwer, not categorically, or directly; But <hi>Elihu</hi> hearing <hi>Job</hi> make ſo many complaints, might ſuppoſe he thought there was no reaſon why God ſhould deal with him as he had done, and then he had been more righteous in his Cauſe than God.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Septuagint</hi> read it without any compariſon at all, which makes the meaning much more eaſie; they ſay not, <hi>My righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs

                  <p>Our Tranſlation is very hard, hardeſt of all, <hi>Thou haſt ſaid, my righteouſneſſe is more than Gods;</hi> yet this <hi>Elihu</hi> might gather up conſequentially from what he ſpake in the 19<hi rend="sup">t</hi>h Chapter, verſ. 6, 7. <hi>Behold I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard, I cry aloud, but there is no judgement.</hi> As alſo from the paſſage, Chap. 23<hi rend="sup">d</hi> verſ. 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. <hi>Even to day is my complaint bitter, my ſtroke is heavier than my groaning:</hi> In both places <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks as if God had not dealt rightly with him, as if God had been over-ſevere in afflicting him, or as if his complainings were ſhort of his ſufferings. In both or either of which, <hi>Job</hi> exceeds the bounds both of truth
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48335:9"/> and duty; ſuch extravagant expreſſions, have no apology but his pain, nor can any thing be an Advocate for him, but this, That Satan who was his Tempter, was alſo his Tormenter, and held him ſo long upon the Rack, that he uttered (as himſelf confeſſed, <hi>Chap.</hi> 42.3.) <hi>that which he underſtood not,</hi> yea words by which <hi>Elihu</hi> underſtood that he ſaid in effect, <hi>My righteouſneſs is more than Gods.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note hence, firſt,
<q>There is no thought of man further from right, than to think there is any unrighteouſneſs in the dealings of God with man.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Man can hardly do any thing that is juſt, and it is impoſſible God ſhould do any thing that is unjuſt. Let God do what he will, it is right, and he is righteous in doing it: Yea, whatſoever evil God doth to a <hi>Job,</hi> to any of his good people, he is good to them in doing it (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.1.) <hi>Truly God is good to Iſrael, even to ſuch as are of a clean heart,</hi> or <hi>clean of heart.</hi> Not only is God Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and Juſt, but Good and Gracious in what he doth: though his diſpenſations are often very ſad, yet they are never unequal; and as the worſt of men ſhall at laſt acknowledge that he is juſt; ſo the beſt of men, a <hi>Job,</hi> a <hi>David,</hi> ſhall find and ſee at laſt with joy and thankſgivings, that God hath been good, yea beſt to them (conſidering their ſtate) in his ſoreſt and ſevereſt dealings: For <hi>all the paths of the Lord</hi> (as wel hard as ſofr, as well thoſe that are ſet with Bryars and Thorns, as thoſe that are ſet with Roſes) <hi>are mercy and truth,</hi> (mercy as much as truth) <hi>unto ſuch as keep his Covenant, and his Teſtimonies,</hi> Pſal. 25.10. He that ſhews mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy cannot but ſhew righteouſneſſe to his in all his wayes. <hi>As he that doth righteouſneſs, is righteous,</hi> (1 John 3.7.) ſo he that is righteouſneſſe, cannot but do righteous things. God is not only righteous, but righteouſneſſe; he is eſſentially righteous, his righteouſneſſe is himſelf: A mans being, and his righteouſneſſe are two things. The man may ſubſiſt without righteouſneſſe (all men by nature, and while nothing but nature, though much ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated and refined, if not converted, are unrighteous) but it is as impoſſible for God not to be righteous, as not to be. How can he who is righteous, yea righteouſneſſe it ſelf, but do righteous things in all he doth, in every cauſe, in every proceeding, whether with Perſons, Families, or Nations? Is it not then a moſt
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48335:10"/> unrighteous thing to think or ſay God hath, or can do any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous thing?</p>
                  <p>Secondly Note,
<q>He that complains that God deals over-ſeverely with him, or otherwiſe than is fit, or otherwiſe than he hath deſerved, makes himſelf, as to his Cauſe, more righteous than God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we ſay a man deals otherwiſe with us then we have deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at his hands, we judge him, as to that action, uneven and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt in his dealings. Surely then, if we think or ſpeak hardly of the hardeſt wayes of God, we ſpeak and think hardly of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. We cannot think well of God, unleſſe we ſay all that he doth is well done. A thought, that there is but one twig in our rod more than is meet, or fit, or more than is good for us, or to think it abides one minute longer upon our backs, than is meet, or fit, or good for us, is to ſay, <hi>Our righteouſneſſe is more than Gods;</hi> yea, 'tis to ſay, Our wiſdom is more than Gods, and our mercies are more than the mercies of God. Therefore take heed of ſuch thoughts. Though we cannot ſee the righteouſneſſe of God in his works, yet we muſt ſay his wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ks are righteous. It can never be right, not only to ſay, <hi>Our righteouſneſs is more than Gods,</hi> but ſo much as to ſay, <hi>Our righteouſneſs is any thing to Gods.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly Note,
<q>What we ſpeak raſhly, may at any time be preſt upon us hardly, and is ſometimes very uncharitably.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is very uſual with thoſe who accuſe, or oppoſe others, to take things doubtful for certainties, their own conjectures for the aſſertions of their adverſarie, and every thing which hath a likeneſſe to an errour, to be errour. <hi>Elihu</hi> might have ſpoken more favourably to <hi>Job,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In diſputando cavendum, ne ex dictis adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarii per falſam conſequentiam abſurda dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camus, quibus illum grava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, qua in re hic peccavit Elihu. <hi>Piſc.</hi>
                     </note> he might have conſtrued his ſayings more candidly than he did: Had he taken <hi>Jobs</hi> words with a grain of Salt (as we ſpeak) he needed not to have put ſo much Gall and Wormwood into his own: Had he not interpreted <hi>Jobs</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints ſtrictly, according to the ſound, or letter, but conſidered them with his ſcope, his aime, and purpoſe in ſpeaking ſo, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the extream pain of his body, and anguiſh of his ſoul, when he ſpake ſo, he had never given him ſuch cutting an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers.</p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:48335:10"/>
                  <p>But God juſtly, and in much wiſdome, ſharpned the ſpirit of <hi>Elihu,</hi> to ſpeak cutting words to <hi>Job,</hi> that <hi>Job</hi> feeling the ſmart, might be made ſenſible of his errour, and at laſt be brought low, and broken under his hand. Milde words may skin a ſore before 'tis ſearcht to the bottom, and ſo not only retard the Cure, but endanger the Patient. The holy Apoſtle fore-ſeeing the murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, quarrels and diſputes which fleſh and blood would make about Election or Predeſtination, doth not go about ſo much to anſwer them by Reaſon, as to repreſſe them by a ſtrong Reproof, and vehement Objurgation, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 9.20.) <hi>Nay, but O man, who art thou that replyeſt againſt God! ſhall the thing formed, ſay to him that formed it, why hast thou made me thus? hath not the Potter power over the Clay?</hi> &amp;c. Now as about that unſearchable depth of eternal Election, ſo about preſent dreadful diſpenſations, and providences, our undue reaſonings and tumultuating thoughts of heart, concerning God, breaking our bounds, and forgetting with whom we have to do, or who hath to do with us, call for and deſerve ſharpeſt reproofs; <hi>Who are you that reply againſt God! Who are you that think this to be right <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="4 letters">
                           <desc>••••</desc>
                        </gap>h you do, or any thing wrong which God doth? Who are you, that you ſhould preſume to ſay</hi> (ſo much as by inference) <hi>that your righteouſneſs is more than Gods,</hi> or, <hi>that it is any thing compared with the righteouſneſs of God!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>Thou haſt ſaid, my righteouſneſs is more than Gods.</q>
                  <p>What <hi>Job</hi> had ſaid, which might give colour for this accuſation, hath been touched before, in the mention of thoſe Speeches, or Paſſages, forced from him by the greatneſſe of his ſuffering. But <hi>Elihu</hi> gives it us yet more expreſſely in the next verſe.</p>
                  <q>
                     <bibl>
                        <hi>Verſ. 3.</hi>
                     </bibl> For thou ſaidſt, What advantage will it be unto thee, and what profit ſhall I have, if I be cleanſed from my ſin?</q>
                  <p>As if he had ſaid, O <hi>Job,</hi> If thou ſhouldeſt ask me, when or where thou haſt ſaid, <hi>My righteouſneſs is more than Gods?</hi> or how can I prove that thou haſt ſaid ſo? I may ſoon anſwer thee, and eaſily prove it thus, thou haſt ſaid, <hi>What advantage will it be unto thee?</hi> &amp;c. Thou haſt ſpoken as if no good were to be gotten by turning from evill; or that thou ſuffereſt evil, being thy ſelf free, at leaſt turned from doing evil; and that therefore it availeth
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48335:11"/> thee no more that thou art righteous, than if thou wert the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſinner in the world. <hi>So</hi> thou haſt ſaid, and in ſaying ſo, thou haſt ſaid what I have charged thee with.</p>
                  <p>But here the Queſtion may ariſe again, as much about the Proof, as about the Charge. When did <hi>Job</hi> ſay, <hi>What advantage will it be unto me? and what profit ſhall I have, if I be cleanſed from my ſin?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, as he ſaid not the former words contained in the Charge directly, they were only a collection raiſed conſequenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by <hi>Elihu,</hi> ſo he ſaid not theſe words which are the proof of the Charge expreſſely, but by conſequences.</p>
                  <p>For the clearing of this, we muſt diſtinguiſh of what is meant by <hi>profit</hi> and <hi>advantage,</hi> when <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith, <hi>Thou ſaidſt, What advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage ſhall it be unto thee, and what profit ſhall I have, if I be cleanſed from my ſin?</hi> This advantage and profit may be conſidered,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, As to his eternal well-being and ſalvation; Secondly, as to his preſent eaſe and conſolation.

Take away eternal reward and puniſhment, and where's Religion? where's either the love or fear of God? His meaning then is, that <hi>Job</hi> had ſaid, it would be no profit, no boot to him for the preſent, or as to his then condition, if he were cleanſed from his ſin. This <hi>Elihu</hi> might gather from thoſe two places (Chap. 9.22, 23.) <hi>This is one thing, therefore I ſaid it, He deſtroyeth the perfect and the wicked. If the ſcourge ſlay ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he will laugh at the tryal of the innocent.</hi> As if <hi>Elihu</hi> had ſaid, Thou canſt not avoid this proof of my firſt Charge; for he that ſaith, <hi>God deſtroyeth the perfect and the wicked,</hi> that is, the perfect as well as the wicked, ſaith alſo in effect, <hi>What profit is it, that I am cleanſed from my ſin?</hi> But thou haſt ſaid the former, therefore the latter alſo. Again thou haſt ſaid (Chap. 10.15.) <hi>If I be wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, wo unto me, and if I be righteous, yet will I not lift up my head. I am full of confuſion, therefore ſee thou mine affiiction;</hi> weigh thy words, Thou haſt ſaid, <hi>Wo to me, if I be wicked, and if I be righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> (it will not be much better with me) I will not, I dare not lift up my head, my confuſion is ſo great. How great ſoever my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48335:11"/> is, I have little comfort, or 'tis much-what alike with me, whether I be righteous, or wicked. In theſe places, and by theſe ſpeeches <hi>Job</hi> ſeems to put little or no difference between the dealings of God with the wicked and the righteous. Once more. Thoſe words (<hi>Chap.</hi> 9.28, 29, 30.) are of a like import, <hi>I am afraid of all my ſorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent. If I be wicked, why then labour I in vaine? if I waſh my ſelf with ſnow water, and make my hands never ſo clean; yet ſhalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own cloaths ſhall abhorre me.</hi> Saying this, thou haſt ſaid, how innocent ſoever I am, I ſhall not be dealt with as an innocent; if I make my ſelf never ſo clean, God will throw me into the ditch, that is, into affliction. From theſe ſpeeches <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihu</hi> might charge <hi>Job</hi> with ſaying, <hi>What profit is it</hi> (as to my tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral good) <hi>that I am cleanſed from</hi> ſpiritual evil, <hi>my ſin?</hi> As for his eternal eſtate, that's not the matter controverted in this book. The ſumme of all amounts to this, If I am cleanſed from my ſin, I may be as great a ſufferer and as hardly dealt with in this world, as if I were altogether unclean. And hence it might be inferred, Surely <hi>Job</hi> was more righteous than God, becauſe while he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to pleaſe God as becometh his people and good ſervants to do, God was pleaſed (inſtead of rewarding him, as he had done many, and promiſed all who do ſo) to afflict him, as he uſeth to do and hath threatned to do to the worſt of evil men, the wicked.

                  <p>It hath been ſaid before, that thoſe words, <hi>If I be cleanſed,</hi> are
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48335:12"/> not found expreſly in the Hebrew Text; And the word in our Tranſlation rendred <hi>ſin,</hi> ſignifieth alſo <hi>puniſhment</hi> or <hi>ſuffering,</hi> which is the fruit or effect of ſin. So that according to this read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Elihu</hi> in theſe words prevents an objection, which <hi>Job</hi> might take occaſion to make from what he had ſaid, or wiſhed rather, at the 36th verſe of the former Chapter. <hi>My deſire is that Job may be tryed unto the end;</hi> That is, further afflicted, or afflicted to the utmoſt. Againſt this deſire of <hi>Elihu, Job</hi> is by him ſuppoſed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his exception, or objection, in this verſe; As if he had ſaid, Why doeſt thou, or what reaſon haſt thou to deſire that I ſhould be yet again tryed by affliction? What, I pray, would that profit me, if I were afflicted yet more and more? Can the ſuffering of evil do me good, or make me better? To this objection, <hi>Elihu</hi> gives anſwer in the next verſe, and thoſe which follow to the ninth; and he doth it (as the Aſſerter of this Interpretation judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) by this Dilemma. Thy afflictions would profit either God or thy ſelf (ſeeing God doth nothing in vaine); but neither thy ſufferings, how grievous ſoever, nor thy doings, how righteous ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, can profit God, no more than thy ſins or evil doings can damage God; therefore it remains, that if God afflict thee fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it will be (if thou haſt a heart to improve it) for thy profit.</p>
                  <p>This reading, and the ſenſe ariſing from it, is much inſiſted on; but as the former is very harſh, ſo I conceive, this latter is very dark and intricate, and grounded upon the ſuppoſition of an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection very remote, or not eaſily to be ſuggeſted in this diſcourſe. And therefore to avoyd both my own and the readers unneceſſary trouble, I ſhall take the Text, as it ſtands in our Tranſlation, and offer ſomewhat for inſtruction from it.</p>
                  <p>How great ſinfulneſs there is in ſaying, <hi>There is no profit in the wayes of God,</hi> I have ſhewed at the 21<hi rend="sup">ſt</hi>

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48335:13"/> if I be cleanſed from my ſin? Elihu</hi> chargeth <hi>Job</hi> with this; yet ſtill remember, he referrs not to his eternal, but temporal condition. And this was <hi>Aſaphs</hi> or <hi>Davids</hi> temptation alſo, as to his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral condition; even he, the one or the other, <hi>David</hi> or <hi>Aſaph</hi> ſpake as much in expreſs terms, as <hi>Job</hi> is here charged with, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.13.) where complaining of the great tryals and troubles he had been under, and of the proſperity of the wicked; <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>theſe are the ungodly, who proſper in the world, they increaſe in riches.</hi> But how is it with me? <hi>Verily I have cleanſed my heart in vaine, and waſhed my hands in innocency; for all the day long have I been plagued, and chaſtned every moment.</hi> As if he had ſaid, What have I got by my holineſs, and forſaking of ſin? what have I gained by my ſtricteſt walkings, and abſtainings from the very appearance of evil? Have I not reaſon to conclude, in good earneſt, that <hi>I have cleanſed my heart and hands in vaine,</hi> ſeeing my ſufferings are not leſsned, though my ſins are, ſeeing my puniſhments are renewed every morning, though I am every mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning upon the renewal of my repentance? Thus ſpake the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> in the day of his temptation; and doubtleſs, this day of his Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had been a day of temptation and provocation to the Lord, (like that of <hi>Iſraels</hi> in the Wilderneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95.7.) had not the Lord come in by his grace, and helped him to bite in his words at the very next verſe; <hi>If I ſay, I will ſpeak thus,</hi> (if I uſe ſuch, not only uncomely, but wicked language as this, <hi>I have clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed my heart and hands in vaine) Behold, I ſhould offend againſt the generation of thy children.</hi> And <hi>when I thought to know this, it was too wonderful for me;</hi> that is, it was beyond my skill to reconcile theſe works, theſe providences of God towards me, with his word and promiſes; nor was I any whit leſs at a loſs, how to reconcile the proſperity and flouriſhing condition of wicked men, with thoſe terrible threatnings which the Lord in his Word every where thunders out againſt them. Theſe croſs and intricate diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons puzzel'd me greatly, put my ſoul into a maze; nor could I ſpel their meaning, nor make out the ſenſe of them, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntill I went into the Sanctuary of God, then underſtood I their end;</hi> the woful Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrophe, the miſerable end of wicked-men, their ſlippery ſtanding, and their ſudden falling, as both are deſcribed (<hi>v.</hi> 18, 19, 20.)

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48335:13"/> (<hi>v.</hi> 24, 25, 26.) then I underſtood what profit and advantage comes by cleanſing our ſelves from ſin, though to the eye it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare not, yea though all appearances ſpeak the contrary. To be cleanſed from, or to remove ſin is profitable and advantagious:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, As to the removal of Judgement. When we begin cleanſing work, the Lord uſually makes an end of afflicting work. For as one great end of ſending affliction, is to cleanſe us from ſin, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.9.) <hi>By this ſhall the iniquity of Jacob be purged, and this is all the fruit, to take away his ſin;</hi> ſo our being clean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ed from ſin is uſually the end of our afflictions. When we are cleanſed from ſin, we are troubled no more, we ſmart no more: ſpeak then, Is it no profit to be cleanſed from ſin, when ſo many, not only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but Nations have been ruin'd, becauſe not cleanſed from ſin? God gave his own people cleanneſs of teeth, (<hi>Amos</hi> 4.6.) that is, famine or want of bread, becauſe of the uncleanneſs of their hearts, and lives; and is it no profit to be cleanſed from ſin, when for our ſinfull uncleanneſſes God will cleanſe us of all our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, even to a morſel of bread? 'Tis therefore a ſpeech both falſe in it ſelf, and highly di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>honourable unto God, to ſay, I ſhall have no profit, for ſtill I ſhall ſuffer, though I be cleanſed from my ſin; whereas firſt, there is more profit in being cleanſed from ſin, than in being delivered from ſufferings; and, ſecondly, when once we are cleanſed from ſin, we are in the faireſt way to be clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from, and ſee an end of all our ſufferings.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The more we are cleanſed from ſin, the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion we have with God, and the more peace from God. Is not this a great profit? a profit beſides the eternal reward? a profit far better than any temporal reward? Will not communion with God ſatisfie us for the loſs of friends, of eſtate, or health? Will not peace with God anſwer all the tribulations we can meet with in this world? If therefore being cleanſed from ſin, we have cloſer communion and ſweeter peace with God, let no man ſay, <hi>What profit ſhall I have, if I be cleanſed from my ſin?</hi> And, although there ſhould be no preſent profit, or advantage, though no viſible, no nor ſpiritual income, as to preſent comfort, ſhould redound to us in this world, by being cleanſed from ſin, yet remember, it is our profit, and our beſt profit to be cleanſed from ſin, to be emptied of ſin, to mortifie ſin, to deſtroy ſin; if we ſhould have no profit in hand by leaving ſin, yet there is a profit promiſed, that infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48335:14"/> exceeds all the profits and pleaſures which we can have or hope for by retaining our ſin; ſuch profit and pleaſure, as will abundantly recompence us for all the worldly loſſes we are at, and penitential ſorrows which we paſs thorow in keeping or clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing our ſelves from ſin. The Apoſtle rejoyced at the ſorrow of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.9.) But is it good to rejoyce at the ſorrow of others? ſhould we not mourn with thoſe that mourn? 'Tis true, we ſhould; yet 'tis good to rejoyce in that ſorrow which doth others good; ſuch was the ſorrow of thoſe <hi>Corinthians.</hi> The Text is exp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Paul) I rejoyce not that ye were made ſorry, but that ye ſorrowed to repentance, for ye were made ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry after a godly manner (or according to God) that ye might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive damage by us in nothing.</hi> There is then no damage, no hurt by ſuch ſorrow; But comes there any good, any profit by it? yes, much every way; <hi>for</hi> (as it followeth, <hi>v.</hi> 10.) <hi>godly ſorrow work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth repentance to ſalvation, not to be repented of;</hi> that is, greatly to be rejoyced in. What is matter of joy, if ſalvation be not? True repentance for ſin, is repentance to ſalvation: And is there not profit, is there not all profit in that? As there is a <hi>Fountain opened</hi> (the blood of Chriſt) <hi>for ſin and for uncleanneſs</hi> (Zech: 13.1.) that is, for waſhing away the uncleanneſs of ſin; ſo there are abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of bleſſings flowing from that Fountain, to all ſuch as by the actings of Faith and Repentance waſh and are clean.</p>

                  <p>THe former Context contained the Charge which <hi>Elihu</hi> brought againſt <hi>Job,</hi> that he ſhould ſay, <hi>His righteouſneſs was more than Gods,</hi> and that <hi>it would be no profit to him; if he were cleanſed from his ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Context of theſe five Verſes, <hi>Elihu</hi> gives anſwer to thoſe (had <hi>Job</hi> poſitively and purpoſely ſaid, or aſſerted them) blaſphemous ſayings, or aſſertions. And we have here.</p>

                  <p>Again, Suppoſing (as indeed they do) that the Clouds move in the lower part of the Heavens, it encreaſeth and hightens the ſenſe of the words to the purpoſe, for which <hi>Elihu</hi> makes uſe of them. As if he had ſaid, Behold and ſee the Heavens, the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Heavens, the Starry Heavens, they are higher than thou, yea, behold the Clouds which are neereſt to us, and much, very much below the Starrs, thoſe eſpecially which Aſtronomers call the <hi>fixed Starrs;</hi> yet do but behold the Clouds, which at the top of ſome hills one may touch with his hand, (ſome deſcribe great men hiding their heads among the Clouds) Behold, I ſay, the Clouds which are loweſt, yet they are higher than thou, they are beyond thy reach; much more the Heavens, moſt of all God, who is higher than the higheſt Heavens. Thou canſt neither add to, nor diminiſh or blemiſh the beauty of the Heavens, thou canſt not make a cloud better or worſe; What then canſt thou do to or againſt the God of Heaven? To convince <hi>Joh</hi> of this, is the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of <hi>Elihu</hi> in calling him to the view of the Heavens. Now foraſmuch as <hi>Elihu</hi> invites <hi>Job</hi> to the view and Contemplation of the Heavens;</p>
                  <p>Note; Firſt,
<q>It is our duty to ſtudy and meditate the natural works of God, or his works in Nature; Eſpecially the Heavens, which are ſo eminent a part of his works.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Scripture calls ſome, <hi>Starr-gazers,</hi> ſuch are they, who
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48335:17"/> ſtudy the Heavens to a very evil purpoſe, drawing men off from their ſole dependance upon God, by foretelling the events of things, and deſtinies of perſons, from the poſitions and motions of the heavenly Bodies or Luminaries. This kind of Studying and Contemplating the Heavens, is one of the greateſt vanities under Heaven, a vanity often reproved in the Scriptures of the holy Prophets; thus to be <hi>Starr-gazers,</hi> or <hi>Heaven-beholders</hi> is our ſin: but there is a Contemplation of the Starrs which is our duty and commendation, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.3, 4.) <hi>When I conſider</hi> (in that great volume of the works of God) <hi>the Heavens, the work of thy fingers, the Moon and the Starrs which thou haſt ordained; What is man that thou art mindfull of him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>David</hi> did both look and ſee, he beheld the Heavens for a good purpoſe, a godly purpoſe, his own abaſement, and the advancement of the glory and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or of the glorious goodneſs of God, in ſpreading ſuch a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopy, ſparkling with perpetual fires for him to walk under, and do his work by. And doubtleſs, did we with enlightned eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and ſee the natural Heavens, we ſhould become more ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and heavenly.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In that we have here three words, <hi>look, ſee,</hi> and <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold.</hi> Note,
<q>The works of God, Eſpecially the Heavens, are diligently to be Conſidered.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>We may look to the Heavens and not ſee, we may ſee the Heavens and not behold them. Let me here again mind the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Emphaſis of that word; it notes a looking unto, or upon the Object, as a Hunter looks for a Hare, or a Fowler for a Bird; how doth he pry and look into every tuft and buſh? So the word is uſed (<hi>Jer.</hi> 5.26.) <hi>Among my people are found wicked men: they lay waite</hi> (or they eye and behold) <hi>as one that ſetteth ſnares, they ſet a trap, they catch men.</hi> All the viſible works of God, much more the Heavens ſhould be diligently conſidered, <hi>lookt into, ſeen, and beheld.</hi> It was a good Concluſion of one of the Ancients, who ſaid, <hi>That man hath not looked unto Heaven,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In coelum ron ſuſpicit, qui coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum tantum a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicit. <hi>Origen.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>that hath only looked upon Heaven.</hi> A bare look is not ſufficient, he muſt look with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, or till he cannot forbeare to admire, as the firſt Latine word in that ſentence ſignifies properly. A man may look upon a Picture, and yet not behold it diſcerningly; he may ſay, that's the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48335:18"/> picture of a man, yet not conſider the Art of the workman in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; he may ſee it is the picture of a man, not of a beaſt, at a look, but he muſt ſee it exactly, if he would find out the worth and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the commodiouſneſſe of its Scituation; to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern theſe calls for ſerious conſideration, and ſetled reviews. As in the Natural works of God, the Heavens made for man, ſo much more in his Spiritual works, the making of a Heaven in man, or man Heavenly, require our deepeſt thoughts, and moſt ſtudious re-ſearches. O how many are there who look tranſiently upon thoſe works of God, who never ſee nor behold them, never enter into the ſecrets of them! many know ſome Truths, yet never looked into any, nor laboured to <hi>comprehend with all Saints</hi> (or as all Saints ought to do) <hi>what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ght</hi> of them; and therefore attain not to that <hi>riches of the full aſſurance of underſtanding, to the acknowledgement of the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of God, and of the Father, and of Chriſt,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks (<hi>Col.</hi> 2.2.) but are <hi>like children toſſed to and fro, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed about with every wind of Doctrine,</hi> as the ſame Apoſtle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes them, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.14. Remember, we are to <hi>look</hi> and <hi>ſee,</hi> and <hi>behold</hi> the Natural wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ks of God, how much more the Spiritual Myſteries of the Goſpel, and the works of grace? theſe indeed are to be looked upon, and ſeen, and beheld, thoſe other are not to be left unlooked upon.</p>
                  <p>Note, Thirdly,
<q>The Heavens are a Divine Glaſſe, wherein we may ſee much of God; they are a Natural Alphabet, the Letters whereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well placed, and rightly put together, we may ſpell the name of God, his Wiſdome, Power, and Goodneſſe.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus the Apoſtle argues (<hi>Rom.</hi> 1.19, 20.) <hi>That which may be known of God is manifeſt in them,</hi> or <hi>to them;</hi> that is, to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Heathens. His proof for this, is taken from the poynt now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed: For <hi>the inviſible things of him from the Creation of the world are cleerly ſeen, being underſtood by the things that are made, even his eternal Power and God-head.</hi> The Apoſtle layes it down in general, Whatſoever is made, whatſoever is part of the Creation, holds out ſomewhat of God: The very Clods of the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48335:18"/> Earth declare his Power; how much more the Clouds and Starrs of Heaven? Therefore <hi>Look to the Heavens, Behold the Clouds,</hi> conſider them, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.2.) <hi>They declare the Glory of God, and the Firmament ſheweth his handy-work.</hi> If you ask more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, what do they declare? I anſwer, Firſt, That God is; every Creature doth ſo; if there be a Creature, there muſt needs be a Creator; If there be Effects, there muſt be an Efficient; the made Heavens declare their Maker. Secondly, The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens declare, not only that God is, but that he is above. Chriſt hath taught us to pray, <hi>Our Father, which art in Heaven;</hi> God is every where, yet there eſpecially; Heaven is the Habitation of his Holineſſe, and of his Glory. Thirdly, In the purity of the Heavens, we may ſee the holineſſe and purity of God; and they being ſo incorruptible and unchangeable, declare Fourthly, The incorruptibility and unchangeableneſſe of God: He that made them ſuch, is much more ſuch himſelf. The very unchangeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Heavens, is changeable, compared with the unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſſe of God. <hi>The Heavens</hi> (ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 102.25, 26.) <hi>are the work of thy hands; they ſhall periſh, but thou ſhalt endure</hi> (or <hi>ſtand), yea all of them ſhall wax old like a Garment: as a Veſture ſhalt thou change them, and they ſhall be changed; but thou art the ſame, and thy years ſhall have no end.</hi> Fifthly, The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens which God hath built as a Houſe for himſelf, being ſo high above the touch of the Creature, ſhew us that God is infinitely exalted above the reach and moleſtation of ſinful man; that's the thing which <hi>Elihu</hi> aims at, as appears by what followeth in the next words. <hi>Look to the Heavens, and ſee, behold the Clouds which are higher than thou.</hi>

The ſins of the old world (which was a world of ſin, all fleſh having corrupted their way before God, and there being but one righteous Family found in it) all thoſe ſins (I ſay) did not dammage God at all, but indeed they glorified both his Patience and his Juſtice; his Patience, in ſparing them ſo long, even an hundred and twenty years after warning given; his Juſtice, in ſending the Flood at laſt, which brought ſwift deſtruction upon them, and ſwept them all away.

We have an illuſtrious proof of this, in that extreamly evil and unnatural practiſe of men good in the main, the holy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs, againſt their own Brother (<hi>Gen.</hi> 50.20) who told them plainly, when he meant them no evil, but good, <hi>But as for you, ye thought evil againſt me, but God meant it for good; to bring to paſs, as it is this day, to ſave much people alive.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Further, To clear the Point in general, we may diſtinguiſh of ſin, as having a threefold oppoſition; Firſt, Againſt our ſelves. Secondly, Againſt our Neighbour. Thirdly, Againſt God. This diviſion or diſtinction of ſins, muſt be ſo underſtood that the two former, namely, ſin againſt our ſelves, and againſt our Neighbour, brings a real detriment, and diſadvantage to our ſelves, and to our Neighbour. But as ſin hath reſpect to God, it doth not bring any real detriment to him: Only it may be ſaid, Firſt, The will of many ſinners is raiſed up to that height of wickedneſſe, as pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely to ſet themſelves to diſhonour God, to blaſpheme his
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48335:21"/> name, and <hi>do deſpight to the Spirit of Grace,</hi> (Heb. 10.29.) which is the utmoſt length that ſin or luſt can go. Secondly, The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of every ſin, or every ſin conſidered in its nature, is a wrong or a hurt to God; for it is an unconformity to his Will, and a breach of his Law: Yet as to himſelf God receives no hurt, nor poſſibly can receive hurt by any, the fouleſt, moſt ſinful ſin.</p>
                  <p>But ſome may ſay, <hi>Doth not ſin damage God at all; could Ellhu ſay in Truth, What doſt thou againſt him, or into him, if thou ſinneſt?</hi> Is ſin nothing to God? The Church complained, and cryed out to thoſe that paſſed by her, (<hi>Lam.</hi> 1.12.) <hi>Is it nothing to you, all ye that paſſe by?</hi> Are all my afflictions nothing to you? May not God ſay much more, Are all your tranſgreſſions nothing unto me? Are our ſins nothing to him? Is he unconcerned in them? How can this be? There are ſeveral Scripture-Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which ſhew cleerly that we do much againſt God when we ſin, and much for him when we ſin not, or abſtain from ſin.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, When a People, eſpecially when a profeſſing Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſin, <hi>The name of God is prophaned;</hi> and is that nothing to God? Is it not againſt God, to have his name p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ophaned? We find the Lord charging this upon his People (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.20, 21.) <hi>They prophaned my name among the Heathen,</hi> &amp;c. To prophane the name of God, is to make it as an unholy, as a common, yea, as a corrupt thing; and is this nothing to God?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To ſin is to <hi>diſhonour God,</hi> 'tis called, <hi>A deſpiſing of God,</hi> (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.30.) <hi>Them that honour me, I will honour; and they that deſpiſe me, ſhall be lightly eſteemed.</hi> Is it nothing to be deſpiſed, to be diſhonoured? If a man be deſpiſed, he thinks himſelf wronged; loſſe of honour is a great loſſe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We find in Scripture, that ſome kind of ſinning is <hi>blaſpheming.</hi> The Apoſtle tels the <hi>Jews (Rom.</hi> 2.24.) <hi>The name of God is blaſphemed among the Gentiles, through you:</hi> That is, his name is evil ſpoken of, a bad report is brought upon his name, he hears ill among evil men, <hi>among the Gentile<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, through you,</hi> that is, through the unanſwerableneſſe of your doings, to your ſayings, or through the unlikeneſſe of your practiſes, to your profeſſion. To blaſpheme the name of God is to ſtrike through, to wound the name of God; it is ſomewhat to a man to have his name ſtruck through with the poyſoned Arrows and Darts of reproach. An ill tongue falls heavy, and cuts deep. A blaſphemed name is a
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48335:21"/> tongue-beaten name: And is this nothing to God?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Some ſins are not only in themſelves a contempt of God, but they are committed in contempt of God. When men ſin preſumptuouſly, and with a high hand; when they ſin with a command ſhining in their eye, with a threat ſounding in their ear, they even ſend a defiance to Heaven, and bid God do his worſt: And is this nothing againſt God? nothing unto God? One of the Ancients writing at large of two Cityes,<note place="margin">Auguſtinus, l. 14. <hi>De Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitate Dei.</hi> cap. 28.</note> calleth one of them, <hi>The earthly and unholy City, made by the love of our ſelves, even to the loathing and contempt of God.</hi> (Love to our ſelves, riſing up to the contempt of God, doth all the miſchief in the world) The other City he calleth <hi>holy and heavenly, and that</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is built by the love of God, or when we love God even to a loathing and contempt of our ſelves, and of all our own concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, intereſts and advantages.</hi> When a man comes to love God with a loathing of himſelf, then he is indeed a builder of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly City: And when ſinners act with an inordinate love to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they at once caſt contempt upon God, and build that bad City; and is this nothing to God?</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, The Scripture ſaith, <hi>God is angry with ſin.</hi> A wiſe man will not be angry with that which is nothing to him, or which doth nothing againſt him; a wiſe man will not be angry for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, much leſſe will the only wiſe God.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, The Scripture ſaith, <hi>God is grieved for the ſins of men.</hi> Surely God will not be grieved for that which is nothing unto him. Himſelf ſaith, ſinners <hi>fret him,</hi> (Ezek. 16.43.) <hi>Thou haſt fretted me in all theſe things.</hi> A well tempered man will not fret for that which doth not ſome way or other afflict him. We read (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.10.) That <hi>Iſrael vexed his holy Spirit ſo much, that he was turned to be their enemy, and fought againſt them.</hi> And had they done nothing againſt him? Yea, it is ſaid (<hi>Gen.</hi> 6.6) God was ſo much afflicted with the ſins of the old world, that <hi>he repented that he had made man upon the Earth, and it grieved him at his heart.</hi> Doubtleſs that is ſomewhat to God, which grieves him thus, and goes to his very heart. And let us take heed of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſin is nothing to God; though <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith here to <hi>Job, What doſt thou unto him, if thou ſinneſt?</hi> Sin hath done all the miſchief to man that ever was done him, nor can any thing do him a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, but his ſin. And though God, as <hi>Elihu</hi> argueth truly, be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48335:22"/> the reach of any miſchief that ſin or ſinners can do him, yet upon tryal they will be found guilty of, and caſt for doing much, and that very miſchievouſly againſt God. And therefore</p>

So then, Conſider God in himſelf, and 'tis true, our ſins are nothing to him, they hurt him no more than the Starres are hurt by throwing ſtones into the Ayre at them, or the Sun is hurt by caſting Darts up at it, or the Moon is hurt by the barking of Dogs at it; we can no more hurt or hinder that good or glory of God by our ſins, than Sun, Moon and Starres in Heaven, are hurt or hindred in their Courſe, by ſuch angry aſſaults from Earth.</p>
                  <p>But</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Conſider the manifeſtations of the glory of God, and this is hindred, or damaged by ſin. That's the meaning of all thoſe Scriptures, where 'tis ſaid, <hi>his name is prophaned, diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, blaſphemed;</hi> the preſent manifeſtations of his glory, which ſhould break out every where, are clouded and eclipſed by ſin. And this, their ſins do eſpecially who profeſſe his name. Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors are oblieged where-ever they come, to hold out the ſavour and excellency of his name: And therefore God will deal with knowing ſinners, as with thoſe that hurt and wound him, as with thoſe that have grieved and broken him, as wi h thoſe who have burdened and troubled him, yea, as with thoſe who would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy him.<note place="margin">Peccatum <hi>1</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catur Deicidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um appetens <hi>ſc:</hi> Deum de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruere.</note> Sin is an enemy to God, and would dethrone and thruſt him out of the world; therefore ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nners ſhall be dealt with as ſuch as have highly hurt and wronged God. Sinners have ſometimes riſen up to ſuch expreſſions of wickedneſſe, that they would even pull God out of Heaven; it is in the nature of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſin, and in the ſpirit of many ſinners to do ſo, they carry a day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enmity in their hearts.</p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:48335:22"/>
                  <p>Therefore woe to thoſe who ſay of God, God is not hurt by our ſins? why then ſhould we trouble our ſelves about them? yes, the Lord will at laſt let all ſinners know he hath been concerned in their ſins; though they have not at all toucht his Eſſential Glory, yet they have darkned and ſlurr'd the manifeſtations of his Glory. And therefore I anſwer,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, All thoſe Scriptures before alledged, importing that ſin grieves God, vexes him, and is very burthenſome to him; all thoſe are ſpoken either of <hi>God-man, Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who was made like unto us in all things, except ſin, and is ſpoken of in the Hiſtoryes and Propheſies of the Old Teſtament,<note place="margin">Haec de Deo dicuntur <gap reason="foreign">

If grief, anger, repentance, were properly wrought in God, when we ſin, our ſins muſt needs be ſome, yea much annoyance to him. But while man ſees and feels ſuch Effects as theſe paſſions produce, the Lord is infinitely exalted above the leaſt feeling of theſe paſſions, he remains ever the ſame: That's it which <hi>Elihu</hi> ſignifieth, and holds out to <hi>Job;</hi> we may trouble one another, and trouble our ſelves by ſin, but we cannot at all trouble God. <hi>If thou ſinneſt, what doſt thou againſt him, what unto him?</hi> I ſhall conclude, and gather up the ſence of this Context in theſe four brief Deductions. Take two of them Negatively, and two Affirmatively.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>God doth not puniſh ſinners in anger, only, though he be angry only with ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>God doth not puniſh ſinners, at all, for fear.</hi> He fears none, whom none can hurt.</p>
                  <p>The two Affirmatives take thus:</p>
                  <p>Fi ſt, When God puniſheth ſin, he doth it out of pure love to Juſtice, or purely out of love to Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God afflicts the godly in mercy; 'tis not becauſe they have done him hurt, but for their good.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Elihu</hi> proceeds further to prove, that as <hi>Job</hi> could not hurt God by his ſins, ſo his righteouſneſs and innocency were no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to him; and therefore it muſt needs follow, that his ſins could only hurt, and his righteouſneſs only profit himſelf, and ſuch as were like himſelf.</p>

                     </bibl> If thou be righteous, what giveſt thou him?</q>
                  <p>As if he had ſaid; <hi>There is no reaſon (O Job) that thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt at any time (as thou oftentimes haſt) proclaim thy own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, as if that added any thing to God. Job</hi> was not ignorant of that; But the ſpeech of <hi>Elihu</hi> had this ſcope in it, to reprove him for complaining that his goodneſs profited himſelf nothing, becauſe though he was far from wickedneſs, yet he was afflicted, whereas many wicked men proſpered and lived in full content; to which poynt his other friends had not anſwered. And further, <hi>Elihu</hi> urgeth <hi>Job</hi> with this, becauſe he had ſo induſtriouſly defended his own righteouſneſs, as if he would intimate that God was a gainer by it; whereas if God at any time rewardeth our good deeds, that proceedeth from his own goodneſs and Free Grace, not from any obligation which we have put upon him, by what we have done, how well ſoever we have done it. <hi>If thou be righteous, what giveſt thou him?</hi> This ſuppoſition, <hi>if thou be righteous,</hi> hath in it
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48335:23"/> a grant, if not an affirmation, that a man may be righteous; For though all men naturally, or in nature, are unrighteous, yet tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough grace all men, that is, all men who receive grace are righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous: And they who receive grace are righteous under a three-fold notion. Firſt, they are righteous by an imputed righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or by the righteouſneſs of another accounted to them; and thus every godly man is righteous, becauſe freely juſtified. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, they that have grace are righteous by an Inherent Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, by a ſtock or a principle of Righteouſneſs planted in them at their Converſion. In converſion, not only the acts, but the ſtate and nature of a man is changed. He who before was nothing but a bundle of unrighteouſneſs, becomes a righteous man; that is, he hath a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ighteous principle planted in him and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding with him. Thus a godly man is righteous, becauſe he is ſanctified. Thirdly, every man that hath grace, is a Righteous man by a righteouſneſs flowing out from him, or by a practical righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs; he is righteous by the doing of Righteouſneſs; The former is Righteouſneſs by Converſion, this is Righteouſneſs by Converſation; and this ſlows from the former, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks in his firſt Epiſtle (<hi>Chap.</hi> 3.5.) <hi>He that doth righteouſneſs, is righteous;</hi> that is, he is in a righteous ſtate through Juſtification, and hath righteouſneſs planted in him through Sanctification; And he that is thus righteous in his ſtate, is alſo a practiſer of Righteouſneſs in his way. As it is ſaid of that worthy paire <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> (Luke 1.6.) <hi>They were both Righteous, walking in all the Ordinances and Commandements of God blameleſs.</hi> Here was practical Righteouſneſs, they were righteous workers, their courſe was a courſe of Righteouſneſs, as themſelves were in a ſtate of Righteouſneſs. And thus, I conceive, <hi>Elihu</hi> is chiefly to be underſtood here; becauſe righteouſneſs in this place is oppoſed to unrighteous actions. <hi>If thou wert Righteous;</hi> that is, if thy wayes or thy courſes were as righteous, as thou haſt often reported and aſſerted them to be (for <hi>Job</hi> in the 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                     <hi>Chap.</hi> ſaid, <hi>He would not let go his Righteouſneſs, he would hold it till he dyed;</hi> he would never give up his Integrity, how much ſoever his friends accuſed him; he would no more give it up, than give it off, Now ſaith <hi>Elihu, If thou art righteous,</hi> as thou ſayeſt, and ſtandeſt ſo much upon it, let it be granted, ſeeing thou wilt needs have it ſo, <hi>that thou art righteous,</hi> The Septuagint render ſo, <hi>Seeing thou art
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48335:24"/> Righteous,</hi> or <hi>for as much as thou art Righteous,</hi> that is, according to thy own affirmation, yea though God hath ſaid ſo of thee, and born that witneſs of thee) yet what is that to God?</p>

(What giveſt thou him?)</hi> The meaning is, thou giveſt him nothing. <hi>A gift is the beſtowing of ſome good thing where there is no obligation;</hi>

                     </note> that's a gift which a man is not bound to beſtow by any Law of Righteouſneſs; A gift is beſtowed out of meer liberality, or from a free and bountiful ſpirit. Now, ſaith he, <hi>What giveſt thou unto God?</hi> What ſervice is there in all thy righteous wayes and works, which thou art not obliged to tender unto God, or which thou art not bound to do? Thy Righteouſneſs doth not at all oblige God, for whatſoever good thou doeſt, thou art under a command to do it; there is a Law commanding, yea, compelling thee, if thou ſhouldeſt refuſe; doeſt thou performe any duty to God or man, which thou art not bound or ingaged to perform? Surely thou doeſt not, yea thou can'ſt not. Therefore, what giveſt thou unto God?</p>
                  <q>Or what receiveth he at thy hand?</q>
                  <p>The words are plain, giving and receiving are Correlatives; where there is giving, there is uſually receiving; and where there is receiving, there muſt be giving. Sometimes there is giving, where there is no receiving. When <hi>Belteſhazar</hi> promiſed <hi>Daniel</hi> great things, if he could Interpret the hand-writing on the wall, (<hi>Chap.</hi> 5.17.) He anſwered, <hi>Let thy gifts be to thy ſelf, and thy rewards unto another. Daniel</hi> would not receive his offer: There was giving inpro miſe on <hi>Belteſhazars</hi> ſide, but no receiving on <hi>Daniels</hi> ſide. Moſt are ſo much for receiving, that they love the word <hi>give,</hi> as the Prophet taxed and reproved the Rulers of <hi>Iſrael, (Hoſ.</hi> 4.18.) <hi>Her Rulers with ſhame</hi> (that is, ſhameleſsly, or of which they ſhould be aſhamed, or for which all cry ſhame on
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48335:24"/> them) <hi>do love, Give ye;</hi> that word ſounded well, even like ſweet muſick in their ears: And if others did not offer bribes to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Juſtice, they invited them, <hi>give ye,</hi> we are ready to receive. The Apoſtle puts both theſe together in a good way, (<hi>Phil.</hi> 4.15.) <hi>No Church communicated with me as concerning giving and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, but ye only:</hi> And he would have the Church at <hi>Epheſus</hi> to remember thoſe words of the Lord Jeſus, how he ſaid, <hi>It is more bleſſed to give, than to receive,</hi> (Acts. 20.35.) <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi>

But as we have nothing of our own to give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, ſo he hath no need to receive any thing of us.

                  <p>He expreſſeth it not barely, <hi>What receiveth he of thee,</hi> but <hi>of thine hand;</hi> becauſe as the hand is the great Inſtrument of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo alſo of giving; we give and beſtow with the hand, (what hath he received <hi>of thy hand</hi>), there is a ſpeciallitie in that. Conſider thy hand, what can the hand of God take out of thy hand?

And then conſider what the hand of God is; His is, Firſt, a ſtrong hand; Secondly, a large, a wide hand; Thirdly, a hand full already; and, Fourthly, as his hand is full already, ſo it is a hand filling all things; <hi>He openeth his hand, and fills all things with good.</hi> Now God having ſuch a hand, how canſt thou fill his hahd with thy hand? <hi>What receiveth he at thine hand?</hi> I need not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour further in the explication of the words; Take one general Obſervation from them, which I ſhall draw down into ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
                  <q>The Righteouſneſs or Righteous Actions of men, contribute no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to God;</q>
                  <p>They are no advantage to God: The beſt things that we can do,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48335:25"/> cannot at all better God, or God is never the better for them: That is the meaning of <hi>David,</hi> (Pſal. 16.3.) ſpeaking as a type of Chriſt; <hi>My goodneſs extendeth not to thee, but to the Saints which are on the earth, and to the excellent, in whom is all my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. Jerome</hi> was of opinion, that theſe words of the Pſalme were taken out of this place of <hi>Job. (My goodneſs)</hi> that is, my good deeds <hi>extend</hi> not to thee; the good deeds of Chriſt did not add any thing to God, they did not give any thing to God; for it is impoſſible that any good, or any goodneſs ſhould ſo be made an addition to him, who is all, and hath all: but (ſaith he) <hi>to the Saints,</hi> to them my goodneſs extendeth, I can and will do good to them. Thus S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> (Acts 17.25.) <hi>God is not worſhipped with mens hands, as though he needed any thing:</hi> God calls for worſhip, but he is not worſhipped, becauſe he needs our worſhip, or becauſe he would receive ſome benefit at the hand of worſhippers. The ſame Apoſtle puts the queſtion, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 11.35.) <hi>Who hath given unto him, and it ſhall be recompenced unto him again?</hi> As much as to ſay, no man hath given any thing to God, he is above and beyond all the gifts and givings of the creature.</p>
                  <p>There is a three-fold ground of it, why nothing can be given to God, either to oblige him, or to add any thing to him.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, All is due to him, what-ever we do is a debt to him; we cannot make the payment of a debt a gift. Be as holy and as righteous as you will, as exact in your walkings as you can, it is all of debt, and therefore not a gift.

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48335:25"/> where <hi>David</hi> praiſeth the Lord for the offering and gift which he himſelf and his people had brought towards the building of the Temple; And he deſired that his offerings might be accepted of the Lord, not ſo much as they were given by his hand, as becauſe they and the heart to give them, were received from the hand of God. <hi>Wherefore David bleſſed the Lord before all the Congregation, and ſaid, Bleſſed be thou Lord God of Iſrael our Father, for ever and ever, for all that is in Heaven and in Earth is thine; thine is the Kingdome, O Lord, and thou art exalted as head above all. And, now therefore, O God, we thank thee, and praiſe thy glorious Name; But who am I, and what is my people, that we ſhould be able to offer ſo willingly after this ſort; for all things come of thee, and of thy own have we given thee.</hi> And again at the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe; <hi>All this ſtore cometh of thee, and all is thine own.</hi> We cannot be ſaid properly to give another that which is his own already; whatever God receives of us, came from himſelf: And as whatſoever we give comes from God, ſo every action or duty which we performe to God, comes from God; he beſtows the power to do upon us, before we can do any thing, and therefore it cannot be any addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto him. There are two graces, which we exerciſe, very pleaſing to God; firſt, Faith; ſecondly, Charity; yet neither of theſe contribute any thing to God. Faith is ſo far from giving God any thing, that its whole work lyeth in receiving; And though charity be a giving grace, yet it gives to man only, not to God. So then, what doth God receive of man? ſurely nothing but his own. <hi>David</hi> enquires (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.12.) <hi>What ſhall I return to the Lord for all his benefits?</hi> Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Now if God receives nothing at our hands by way of ſupply, or addition, then</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>No Creature is neceſſary unto God.</hi> We all depend on him, he is altogether neceſſary to us, but we are not neceſſary to him; we are and ought to be his Servants, but he doth not need our ſervice; we need ſuch a Maſter, ſuch a Lord, we need to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48335:26"/> have ſuch a one over us, but he needs not ſuch as we are under him. Earthly Maſters and Servants have need of one another; Maſters keep and maintain their Servants, and Servants are very helpful and profitable to their Maſters. As a Servant needs a Maſter to give him meat and drink, aparrel, and the conveniences of this life; ſo the Maſter needs the Servant, he needs his work, his labour, his hand, he cannot tell how to do his buſineſſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him; Maſters cannot live comfortably without their Servants, much leſſe honourably, they cannot keep their State and Degree amongſt men without Servants; and Servants need their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, they cannot ſubſiſt, they cannot live, but by wages, or the reward of their labour. God hath made ſuch a tye, knit ſuch a knot among the Creatures, that one, though a Superiour, ſhould not deſpiſe the other, though much his Inferiour, for both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre as parts, to the conſtitution of the whole, or general conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the world. But God is not a part, but the Principle, or Conſtituter of the Univerſe, not at all depending upon any part of it. If a Servant ſhould have need of his Maſter, and not the Maſter of the Servant, the Maſter would deſpiſe his Servant; but God hath ſo ordered it, that as the Servant needs the Maſter, ſo the Maſter needs the Servant, while himſelf hath no need of either. God hath no need of our ſervice, but we need his ſervice, or him as our Lord and Maſter. <hi>It is an honour to God that he hath ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to ſerve him, but it is his greateſt honour that he needs none to ſerve him.</hi> Before there were either men or Angels, God had the ſame honour and happineſſe that now he hath, he is ſelf-ſufficien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

There is nothing without him, but he can be happy without it; there's no Creature, whether thing or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in Heaven or Earth, neceſſary to God, either as to his Being, or well-Being: And therefore we may ſay, not only to the beſt man on Earth, but to the moſt glorious Angel in Heaven, (as <hi>Elihu</hi> to <hi>Job) What receiveth he of thine hand?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, If what we do, adds nothing to God, if he receive nothing by our moſt righteous ſervices: then ſurely God ſhews
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48335:27"/> wonderful goodneſſe towards us, in that he is pleaſed to make ſo great an account of, and ſet ſuch ſtore by our ſervices and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, even of any, the leaſt good we do in uprightneſſe. Is it not a ſingular comfort that the Lord puts ſo much worth upon what we do, though what we do be of no worth to him? and that God ſhould bind himſelf to us, when he is not at all beholding to us? The Lord doth not ſay, <hi>What do you give me?</hi> or, <hi>What do I receive at your hands?</hi> thereby to put a ſlight upon our perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances and ſervices; 'tis far from the Lord, that becauſe he hath no need of us, therefore to contemn us; no, he declares a g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eat acceptance of any, the leaſt faithfull ſervice to himſelf, or to our brethren, which we do at his command. Though, ſhould we ſtretch our endeavours, and ſtrain our wits to the utmoſt, to do him good we cannot, yet he doth not undervalue what we do, but takes what is well done, well at our hands, and puts all our good deeds into his Book of Remembrance, and we ſhall one way or o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thirdly, We may inferre, <hi>How good is God, who highly rewards us for the good we do, though it do him no good!</hi> Man will ſcarce thank a man for any good that he doth, unleſſe it redound ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to himſelf, much leſſe will he pay or reward another for that ſervice which ſtands him in little, or no ſtead.

                  <p>Fourthly, How doth the goodneſſe of God appear; ſeeing though we can adde nothing to his glory, yet if we do good and righteous things, he tells us that we glorifie him, which is the higheſt commendation imaginable of what we do.

                  </p>
                  <p>Whereſoever ſin is, it doth miſchief. Sin is ſo bad in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it, that we have reaſon enough to avoid it and flye from it, and ſin is ſo dangerous in the Effects of it, that we have further, though not more reaſon to avoid it, and flye from it; indeed we ſhould rather (and that is our ſpiritualneſſe in avoiding of ſin) avoid it becauſe of the evil that is in the Nature of it, becauſe it riſeth up againſt the Will, and breaks the holy Commands of God; we have greateſt reaſon to depart from ſin, becauſe it is a departure from God, becauſe of the blackneſſe and filthineſſe of it; yet not onely the blackneſſe of this Coal, but the fire, the eternal fire that is in it, gives us cauſe enough to depart from it. 'Tis true, a truly gracious heart would not ſin, though he might eſcape all the ſad effects of ſin, but when he hears it is as hot as fire, and as deadly as poyſon, and as killing as the plague; when he hears that it is the ruine of Perſons, and of Families, of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and Nations, when he hears that 'tis ſin which hath done all the hurt and miſchief that ever was in the world, he ſees he hath further reaſon to dread it, and depart from it.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Note;
<q>Sin doth miſchief to man, and to man eſpecially.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sin doth miſchief all the world over; the whole Creation groans under the miſchief and vanity, which ſin hath brought upon it, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.22.) Sin hath done damage to the whole Creation; but the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48335:28"/> great damage which ſin doth, is to man, to him that acts it to others before whom it is acted, or towards whom it is acted. Sin is diſtributed into two ſorts, as to its hurtfulneſſe. Sin either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects our ſelves in the hurt it doth, or others, and thoſe others are either God or our Neighbour; ſin hurts our ſelves moſt, yet ſin as it is a wrong to God, may be ſaid to hurt his honour, and diminiſh the manifeſtation of his glory in the world, (as hath been ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before). And ſin is really a wrong to our Neighbour. There are a number of ſins committed againſt our ſelves, yea, every ſin, though committed againſt our Neighbour, hits and hurts our ſelves; no man can hurt his Neighbour, but he hurts himſelf moſt. So that, although there are many ſins which reſpect others, yet all are againſt our ſelves. Some ſins (unbelief eſpecially, and the neglect of holy duties) hurt our ſelves only; there are ſins which more properly hurt others, as oppreſſion and uncharitableneſſe; there are ſeveral ſins which at once hurt others and our ſelves. Adultery hurts ſelf and others too; evil words hurt our ſelves and others too, as the Apoſtle tells us out of a Poet, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.33.) <hi>Evil communication corrupteth good manners;</hi> that is, you corrupt the good manners of others, you debauch others by unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury ſpeeches; our ill example hurts our ſelves and others. Our Neighbour is hurt by our ſin. Firſt, By any thing that is a wrong to him, as to his Eſtate, or as to his Perſon, or as to his Credit: Secondly, By the ſcandal of it, when we do that which is evil, it hardens the wicked, and makes them go on more ſecurely in their ſin, and keeps them off from the wayes of God; it endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers good men alſo, and diſcourageth them in the duties they owe both to God and man in the profeſſion of the Goſpel. Thus ſin may hurt our ſelves and our Neighbours.</p>
                  <q>Thy wickedneſs may hurt a man as thou art.</q>
                  <p>But why ſaith he <hi>a man as thou art?</hi> What, a man juſt of thy Complexion, or juſt of thy height, ſtature, and pitch? what, a man of thy State and Degree, a man juſt of thy eminency in the world? certainly no; but when he ſaith, <hi>A man as thou art,</hi> his meaning is, <hi>any man,</hi> becauſe all men are in many things alike, they are all mortal, and ſinful, and weak, and apt to receive hurt by the ſins of others.

Fourthly, all men are alike in this, that they are not ſelf-ſufficient, but ſtand in need of the help of one another; He that is helpful to a man like himſelf, helpeth himſelf, and doth acknowledge that (conſidering humane frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) he may have occaſion to call for and deſire the help of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and therefore (ſay ſome) man hath two hands, two armes, that he may underſtand himſelf born as much to need and receive help, as to give it. Thus every man is a man as thou art; and upon theſe and many other Conſiderations thou mayeſt hurt a man as thou art. There is an excellent paradox, handled by ſome of the Ancients;<note place="margin">Nemo poteſt ab alio laedi niſi a ſeipſo, niſi enim quis laedatur a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimo, non lae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditur.</note> 
                     <hi>No man is hurt, but by himſelf;</hi> for unleſs a mans ſoul be hurt, he is not hurt; which is much confirmed by, and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth clearly in the example of <hi>Job.</hi> For the devil planted all thoſe engines, and made all thoſe aſſaults upon and againſt him, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had a deſign to make him poor, childleſs, and diſeaſed, (all which, he knew, could not hurt him) but to make him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient, and to extort one evil and blaſphemous word againſt God from him. But though it be true, that no man is hurt but by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, yet it is true alſo, that the ſin of one man may hurt another. Oppreſſion hurts other men, (as to civils) whether they will or no; but no ſin can hurt another (as to morals) unleſs he will; no man is infected by vice, if himſelf refuſe, and be againſt it; yea the oppreſſions and afflictions which other men thruſt violently upon us, cannot hurt us, unleſs we by our impatience under them bring
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:48335:29"/> hurt to our ſelves. The cruel uſage of Tyrants, did not hurt the Martyrs; when they burnt them, and impriſoned them, and hanged them, they did not hurt them, becauſe they were patient under thoſe oppreſſions, and took their ſufferings for Chriſts ſake with joyfulneſs. What hurt did the poverty and ulcers of <hi>Lazarus</hi> do him? What hurt had <hi>Abel</hi> by that inhumane cruelty of his brother <hi>Cain?</hi> What hurt had <hi>Paul</hi> by all his ſufferings? What any of the Saints, by impriſonment, or baniſhment, by being ſawne aſunder, or ſlain with the ſword? properly no hurt at all. It is out of the power and reach of wicked perſecutors to hurt the Witneſſes of Chriſt, though they have power to ſlay them. <hi>Steven</hi> was not hurt when he was ſtoned, becauſe he freely gave up himſelf. In a word, take it thus; Firſt, no man is hurt by the ſin of another, but as himſelf is pleaſed with, or practiſeth the ſame ſin; Secondly, no man is hurt by the temptations of the devil, but as he conſents and yeilds to them; Thirdly, no man is hurt by the oppoſitions and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions of others, but as he is impatient under them. <hi>Thy wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs may hurt a man as thou art,</hi>
                     <q>And thy Righteouſneſs may profit the ſon of man.</q>

                  <p>That is, thy righteous actions or deeds, may profit the <hi>ſon of man;</hi> that is, thy ſelf, or any man, good or bad. Thoſe words, <hi>may profit,</hi> are not expreſſed, but are clearly implyed in the ſenſe of the Text. Righteouſneſs tends to every mans benefit, it may help and profit thy ſelf, it may be helpfull or profitable to thoſe who are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thee, or with whom thou haſt to do.</p>

                  <p>Wickedneſs turns to mans hurt of it ſelf, but Righteouſneſs doth profit.

For God who doth not reward us according to our iniquities, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.10.) will moſt amply reward us according to our righteouſneſs. The
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48335:30"/> Apoſtle gave command, <hi>Exerciſe thy ſelf unto godlineſs,</hi> (follow that trade well; why?) <hi>for godlineſs is profitable unto all things,</hi> (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8.) it profits by vertue of the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>omiſe, and it hath <hi>the promiſe of this life as well as of that which is to come. (Titus</hi> 3.8.) <hi>This is a faithfull ſaying, and this I will that thou conſtantly affirme, that they which have believed in God, might be carefull to maintain good works,</hi> (why? for) <hi>theſe things are good and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table unto men.</hi> Some expound theſe words, <hi>good and profitable unto men,</hi> chiefly of doctrine; To teach men to follow works, that indeed is good and profitable doctrine; now if it be a good and profitable doctrine to preſs men to good works, to works of Righteouſneſs, then Righteouſneſs it ſelf, and good works, muſt needs be profitable. There is ſuch an excellency in the nature of Righteouſneſs, it is ſuch an honourable, amiable, and beautifull thing in its own nature, that it is enough to draw us to the doing of it (as ſome have ſaid of Vertue in general, <hi>If vertue could be ſeen, it would draw all to the admiration of it;</hi> ſo I ſay of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs in ſpecial, <hi>If it could be ſeen, it would draw all eyes and hearts after it</hi>) But beſides that, here is an excellent Loadſtone, here is profit, thy Righteouſneſs may profit another; profit draws much, it draws on all men in the world; where there is any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and benefit to be had, how do men ſtrive to trade there, as if Heaven were to be had there? now Righteouſneſs is profitable; the exerciſe of Righteouſneſs is no poor trade, there is a great deale of advantage in it; and I might ſhew you how every work, good for the matter, done in a right manner, and for right ends, is profitable to others, and to our ſelves. To ſpeak a good word, may be a means to miniſter grace un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>o a good work, of any ſort, miniſters a gracious example to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders: by doing good, you may draw others to do good; to ſee one walking in wayes of righteouſneſs, invites and allures others into wayes of righteouſneſs; as bad examples corrupt, ſo good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples inſtruct; as bad examples build up for hell, ſo good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples build up for heaven; To be built or helpt on heaven-ward, is the beſt profit in the world, greater profit than the gain of the whole world. And as every good work miniſters a good example to the beholders, ſo works of Charity miniſter comfort and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief to the receivers, as alſo an occaſion of bleſſing God for their benefactors; yea works of Charity to others are profitable alſo
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48335:30"/> to our ſelves, for there is a promiſe of reward to thoſe who mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the leaſt charities to ſuch as deſerve the greateſt charity, though uſually they find the leaſt, (<hi>Math.</hi> 10.42.) <hi>Whoſoever ſhall give to drink unto one of theſe little ones, a cup of cold water on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> (and how cold is their charity who will not give that!) <hi>in the name of a diſciple, ſhall in no wiſe loſe his reward;</hi> that is, he ſhall ſurely have it. Thus we ſee how profit and advantage, even great profit and advantage comes by Righteouſneſs; yet take heed of thinking that your Righteouſneſs deſerves any the leaſt profit at the hand of God. Though we preſs you to Righteouſneſs as profitable, yet it becomes you to ſay, <hi>we are unprofitable ſervants,</hi> and therefore cannot challenge any profit as our due, how righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſoever we are. It doth not at all follow, becauſe we affirme Righteouſneſs will profit us, that therefore Righteouſneſs can juſtifie us, or that, becauſe it is profitable to us, therefore it can ſave us. <hi>All our righteouſneſſes are but as a filthy garment,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, and therefore unprofitable for this thing. The Apoſtle <hi>counted all things loſs</hi> (not gain) <hi>dung</hi> (not profit) <hi>that he might win Christ, and be found in him, not having his own Righteouſneſs,</hi> (Phil. 3.8, 9.) Righteouſneſs is profitable, if you keep it in its proper place, and apply it to its proper uſe; it is profitable to what God hath appointed it; he helps us to work Righteouſneſs, and then rewards us for our righteous working: <hi>God is not unrighteous to forget our work and labour of love, (Heb.</hi> 6.10.) Let us be found in our duty, and then in due time and place we ſhall find our profit. Our experience will teach us at laſt, that while we have been doing good to others, we have done good to our ſelves; <hi>Righteouſneſs is profitable unto all things,</hi> and to all men, as well to thoſe who do it, as to thoſe for whom it is done.</p>

                  <p>I Have diſpatched the firſt of thoſe great Objections which <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hu</hi> made afreſh againſt <hi>Job</hi> in this Chapter, his ſpeaking undu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of God. This context contains a ſecond, with the anſwer to it.</p>
                  <p>The Connection is given by ſome thus; Whereas <hi>Elihu</hi> told <hi>Job</hi> at the 8th verſe, That <hi>his wickedneſs might hurt a man like himſelf;</hi> He here proves, that the wickedneſs of man is very hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to men, ſo hurtfull, <hi>that by reaſon of the multitude of oppreſſions they make the oppreſſed to cry: They cry out by reaſon of the arme of the mighty.</hi> Yet I ſhall not proſecute the words in that depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, but as they are matter of a ſecond complaint or charge brought by <hi>Elihu</hi> againſt <hi>Job.</hi> The charge is laid down in the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, and his anſwer is proſecuted in the 10th, 11th, 12<hi rend="sup">th,</hi> and 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſes.</p>

                  <p>This offended <hi>Job;</hi> the poor cryed, and they had no helper, no deliverer. We may conceive, that <hi>Elihu</hi> gathered up this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint from the words of <hi>Job, (Chap.</hi> 24.12.) <hi>Men groan from out of the City, and the ſoul of the wounded cryeth out, yet God layeth not folly to them:</hi> As if he had ſaid, The Lord lightly paſſeth
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:48335:31"/> by, and takes little notice of the greateſt afflictions, the oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the poor, though righteous men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Elihu</hi> grants theſe general truths; Firſt, that many are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed; Secondly, that many cry out in their oppreſſions; Thirdly, that many remain undeliveeed from, and unreliered in their oppreſſions. God ſometimes ſeemeth not to regard the groans and cryes of the afflicted, nor doth he alwayes preſently take vengeance of oppreſſors according to their folly. <hi>Elihu</hi> grants all this, he grants that many poor men are ſo mightily oppreſſed by the mighty, that they are forced to cry mightily; yet he ſtrongly acquits God from any ſuch imputation, as thoſe words of <hi>Job</hi> ſeem to admit or inſinuate. And in the proſecution of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer (as will appear in opening the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 11<hi rend="sup">t</hi>h verſes) he ſheweth, that the reaſon why the oppreſſed are not delivered, or anſwered when they cry, is in themſelves, and not in God, (and he would have <hi>Job</hi> conſider, whether he were not of that number) <hi>they cry</hi> (ſaith <hi>Elihu</hi>) but they do not cry with ſuch a frame of heart, with ſuch a diſpoſition of ſpirit, as they ought; they cry as men preſſed rather with the weight of their own ſufferings, than toucht with any ſenſe of their ſins, or reverence of the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty of God, giving them up to the power of oppreſſors; or as having any faith in him for their deliverance, or quiet ſubmiſſion to him, who is ready to help all thoſe who religiouſly fly to him for refuge, and is able to bring them out of their da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <q>They make the oppreſſed to cry.</q>
                  <p>They make them cry upon a double Conſideration; Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the miſery which they feel, and are burdened with; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, for the mercy which they deſire, expect, and think long a-coming; men cry for eaſe, for help, for aſſiſtance, for delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: we may ſuppoſe the oppreſſed ones in the Text crying in all theſe reſpects; the burden was ſo heavy upon them, that it made them cry out for the very weight of it, and they cryed and called for ſome charitable, or tender heart, to come and eaſe them of it, and deliver them from it. <hi>Elihu</hi> doth not reſt in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this once, but repeats it again; <hi>By reaſon of the multitude of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions

This is the City to be viſited, ſhe is wholly oppreſſion in the midſt of her.</hi> Not only was <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> a City, but, The City, a City above all Cities, to be viſited by an oppreſſing enemy; and wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>? even becauſe ſhe not only had oppreſſors in her, but was oppreſſion, O how oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive was that City, which was oppreſſion, and that not only in ſome parts of her, but <hi>wholly,</hi> and that not in her skirts and ſuburbs, but in the midſt of her! The Lord, to ſhew that the <hi>Jewes</hi> were ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latively rebellious, or moſt rebellious againſt him, calleth them (in the abſtract) <hi>rebellion,</hi> as the Margin hath it, (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 2.7.) and to ſhew how ſuperlatively oppreſſive they were one againſt another, He calls <hi>Jeruſalem oppreſſion.</hi> Here in the Text we have a <hi>multitude of oppreſſions,</hi> ſurely then, there were a multitude of oppreſſors. To heare of a multitude of ſins of all ſorts, is very ſad, but when there is multitude of one ſort, and that one of the worſt ſort, and ſuch a ſin as cannot go alone, but draws after it a heap of almoſt all ſorts of ſin: what a multitude of ſins are there! It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied, but that oppreſſion is a very common epidemical ſin, if we take and conſider it in the full latitude of it. For there is a two-fold oppreſſion. Firſt, there is a ſecret oppreſſion. To deceive, defraud, or go beyond another, in the Apoſtles ſenſe, is to oppreſs him. And thus 'tis ſaid, (<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12.7.) <hi>He is a Merchant,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48335:33"/> the balances of deceit are in his hand, he loveth to oppreſs.</hi> He doth not oppreſs by violence, with a ſword in his hand, but by craft with balances in his hand; he oppreſſeth while he over-reacheth in dealing and trading. This ſort of oppreſſion runs up and down every where; and though this kind of oppreſſion make not a great cry, yet it is a great ſin, a crying ſin. There is alſo a ſecret op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion under colour of Law; many turn the very Rules of Juſtice into rods of oppreſſion: And this is by ſo much the worſe, by how much it hath the better cover. Secondly, there is an open oppreſſion, the <hi>Nimrods</hi> of the world, the mighty Hunters ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

Now if both ſecret and open op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions are ſo commonly practiſed, oppreſſion may juſtly beare the title of a common ſin.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Note.</p>
                  <q>Oppreſſion is a very crying ſin.</q>
                  <p>That cannot but be a crying ſin, which makes ſo many cry. Oppreſſion then is a crying ſin. Firſt, as to the nature of it: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, as to the effect of it. Oppreſſion cryeth, and it makes thoſe cry who are oppreſſed. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, (<hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.7.) <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion maketh a wiſe man mad.</hi> That which puts a man even out of his wits, or beſides the right uſe of his reaſon, will put him much to the uſe of his tongue, cauſing him to complain, cry out, and clamour. But who are they that are moſt given to, and deepeſt drencht in this ſin of oppreſſion? The Text anſwers, <hi>They cry out by reaſon of the arme of the mighty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note, Thirdly.</p>
                  <q>Power is commonly abuſed to oppreſſion.</q>
                  <p>We read indeed of a poor man oppreſſing the poor, (<hi>Pro.</hi> 28.3.) And <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, that ſuch a mans oppreſſion is the ſoareſt oppreſſion; for he compares it (in the ſame verſe) <hi>to a ſweeping raine, which leaveth no food.</hi> They who have nothing, will take all when they can come by it, and get it. If all men in power ſhould be as hard to their inferiors, as ſome are who have little or no power, there were no living in the world. Neceſſity may drive the poor to be more oppreſſive, than Ability draws the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:48335:34"/> rich. 'Tis a ſad encounter when the poor contend with the poor; The neceſſity of the one knows no mercy, and the imbecility of the other, can give him no help. Nothing hardens the heart ſo much as want or hunger, (<hi>Lam.</hi> 4.10.) They have little or no ſenſe of anothers miſery, who are under the extream ſmart, and feel the biting of their own. But though poor men oppreſs ſoreſt, yet they oppreſs ſeldomeſt and feweſt. They can oppreſs none, but ſuch as are poorer or weaker than themſelves, and cannot do that often. There muſt be an over-matching power in all who oppreſs; and uſually, they who oppreſs, are great and mighty in power. (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 52.1.) <hi>Why boaſteſt thou thy ſelf in miſchief, O mighty man?</hi> The man was mighty, and what did this might ſerve him for? what uſe did he put it to? even to do miſchief. Many have a mind and will enough to do miſchief, who want both power and opportunity to do it: But they who have power and opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to do miſchief, ſeldome want a mind or will to do it. Power is of great uſe to do good, and 'tis a great temptation to do bad things. As <hi>Laban</hi> bragg'd to <hi>Jacob,</hi> and crowed over him as his underling (<hi>Gen.</hi> 31.29.) <hi>It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt;</hi> And what hindred him then, or what hath hindred many in all Ages of the world, from doing that hurt to others, which they had power to do? Not a diſlike or abhorrence of the fact (which through grace ſtops every good man from hurting others, how great ſoever his power is) but a ſecret reſtraint upon their heart, like that, which <hi>Laban</hi> had in a dream, or viſion to his eare; <hi>Take heed thou ſpeak not to Jacob good or bad;</hi> that is, meddle not with him in any caſe to ſtop his journey. The Prophet (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.6.) deſcribing the ſinfulneſs of thoſe times, ſaith; <hi>Behold the Princes of Iſrael, every one were in thee, to their power, to ſhed blood.</hi> They did it, <hi>to their power;</hi> we put in the Margin, <hi>To their arme;</hi> That is, they uſed and improved their arme or power to the utmoſt length and ſtretch for the oppreſſion of others. The Prophet <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie</hi> chargeth that people with ſinning in general at that rate, (<hi>Chap.</hi> 3.5.) <hi>Behold thou haſt ſpoken and done evill things, as thou couldeſt.</hi> Some men ſin (as all men ſhould love and ſerve God) with all their might, with all their ſtrength; they do evil with both hands greedily; that they ſin no more, is not for want of will, but ability. As the people were thus ſet upon all manner of ſin, ſo the Princes upon that ſpecial ſin oppreſſion. They were to

                     </gap>, for ſhedding blood; yea many deſire to get power into their hand, that they may avenge themſelves by their own hand, and be ready to hurt whom and where they do not love. 'Tis not ſo much ambition which provokes ſome men to affect power and greatneſs,<note place="margin">Parati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

Theſe like the great Fiſhes of the Sea, delight to ſwallow up and feed upon the leſſer; or like the great and ſtrong Beaſts of the Forreſt, they tare and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure the Lambs or Sheep of the paſture. They uſe (that is, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed abuſe) their power, not ſo much for their own good, as in wronging their neighbours, whoſe hurt they ſhould never ſeek, and whoſe good they ought to ſeek and promote next their own. Power ſhould be uſed and put forth, for help, not hurt, for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, not ruine; and therefore Magiſtrates, who are the chief mighty men of the earth, who are called <hi>Powers,</hi> (Tit. 3.1.) are alſo called <hi>the Sheilds of the earth;</hi> implying, they are to uſe their power for the defence (a Sheild is for defence) of the oppreſſed, not to oppreſs. The Scripture calls Magiſtrates <hi>Sheilds,</hi> but it never calls the Magiſtrate a <hi>Sword.</hi> It ſaith indeed the Magiſtrate hath a <hi>ſword,</hi> and that he <hi>beareth not the ſword in vaine, (Rom.</hi> 13.4.) that is, he doth not bear it ſo as to bear with evil doers, and never draw it, nor uſe it. But the Scripture doth not ſay, the Magiſtrate is a <hi>Sword,</hi> as it ſaith, he is a <hi>Shield;</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by intimating, that the Power of the Magiſtrate ſhould rather be exerciſed in protecting than in puniſhing, rather in ſaving than deſtroying. What the Apoſtle ſaith concerning the deſigne or purpoſe of his miniſterial office, <hi>We have this power to edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not to deſtruction,</hi> (2 Cor. 13.10.) is true of all power; the primary deſigne of it is for protection, rather than for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and not at all for oppreſſion or vexation. Magiſtrates have Swords, but they are Shields, not Swords; they have a Sword to cut off evil doers, and by that the good are preſerved and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended. Such mighty ones, who delight to be Swords, but care not to be Shields, who are all for cutting and deſtroying, not at all for ſaving, relieving, and protecting, (ſuch mighty ones, I ſay) cauſed the oppreſſed to cry, yea to cry out in <hi>Jobs</hi> time; and in what times ſoever they are, they make the oppreſſed cry out. And the matter, that <hi>Elihu</hi> ſuppoſed <hi>Job</hi> was offended at, was, that God did not hear the cry of theſe oppreſſed ones, nor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48335:35"/> for their deliverance; which yet he hath declared himſelf ready to, as <hi>David</hi> afterward deſcribeth him, (<hi>Pſa.</hi> 12.5.) <hi>For the oppreſſion of the poor, for the ſighing of the needy, now will I ariſe (ſaith the Lord) I will ſet him in ſafety from him that puffeth at him.</hi> But <hi>Job</hi> hearing this cry of the oppreſſed, or crying out of his own oppreſſion, and God ſeeming not to regard it, was ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at the matter. To remove this, <hi>Elihu</hi> anſwers in the next verſe.</p>
                  <q>

                     </bibl> But none ſaith, Where is God my maker, who giveth ſongs in the night?</q>
                  <p>There is a two-fold Expoſition of theſe words, ariſing from a doubt about the Antecedent to <hi>none,</hi> or who is meant by thoſe that ſay not, <hi>Where is God my maker?</hi> Who are thoſe?</p>
                  <p>The firſt Interpretation gives it to the oppreſſors, to the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty men before ſpoken of; <hi>They make the oppreſſed to cry by reaſon of the multitude of oppreſſions;</hi> but none of <hi>theſe mighty oppreſſors ſay, Where is God my maker, that giveth ſongs in the night?</hi> Thus the verſe is tranſlated quite through, with reſpect to wicked op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors, who caſt God out of their thoughts, never ſaying, <hi>Where is God my maker,</hi> who hath ſet me up, who hath given me this power, and given me ſongs, (that is, occaſions of joy) in the night? The wicked have abundance, they can feaſt it and ſing it day and night, yet mind not God the fountain and beſtower of all. This is a truth in it ſelf; and becauſe the interpretation is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon by ſome as the truth intended in the preſent Text,</p>
                  <p>Take this Note from it.</p>
                  <q>Oppreſſors put away the thoughts of God, or mind not God, when they do, or are about to do, miſchief.</q>
                  <p>They make the oppreſſed cry, but they ſay not, <hi>Where is God?</hi> They neither ſpeak nor think of God, who hath cloathed them with power, and made their arme mighty. We finde this frame frequently aſcribed in Scripture to oppreſſors; <hi>Elihu</hi> chargeth <hi>Job</hi> with it, (<hi>Chap.</hi> 22<hi rend="sup">d</hi>) where having told him to his face, of many acts of oppreſſion; <hi>Thou haſt ſtripped the naked of their clothing,</hi> (v. 6.) <hi>Thou haſt withholden bread from the hungry,</hi> (v. 7.) <hi>And the armes of the fatherleſs have been broken,</hi> (v. 9.) Having (I ſay) reckoned up theſe his ſuppoſed oppreſſions, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48335:35"/> (<hi>v.</hi> 13.) <hi>And thou ſayeſt, How doth God know? can he judge through the dark Cloud? David</hi> in prayer, ſpeaks the ſame of his oppreſſors, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 86.14.) <hi>O God, the proud are riſen againſt me, and the aſſemblies of violent men have ſought after my ſoul, and have not ſet thee before them.</hi> (Pſal. 94.5, 6.) <hi>They break in pieces O Lord thy people, and afflict thine heritage; They ſlay the widow, and the ſtranger, and murder the fatherleſs: Yet they ſay, the Lord doth not ſee it, neither ſhall the God of Jacob regard it.</hi> All theſe Scriptures may be reſolved into the Text; <hi>They ſay not, Where is God my maker?</hi> They who do all they can to unmake and undo their fellow-creatures, care not to remember him, who is the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker and creator of us all. But</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I conceive, thoſe words, <hi>None ſaith, Where is God my maker?</hi> are rather to be referred to the oppreſſed, than to the oppreſſors: The oppreſſed cry indeed, but not unto God their maker. As <hi>Job</hi> ſaid; (<hi>Job</hi> 24.12.) <hi>Men groan from out of the City, and the ſoul of the wounded cryeth out, yet God layeth it not to heart;</hi> ſo here <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith, <hi>men groan and cry,</hi> yet themſelves lay not God to heart; <hi>None ſaith, Where is God my maker?</hi> Thus our tranſlation ſeems to carry it, and thus 'tis moſt generally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood; <hi>None of the oppreſſed ſay,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Taking this ſenſe, <hi>Elihu</hi> here begins to aſſigne the reaſon why the oppreſſed are not delivered. As if he had ſaid, 'Tis true, there are a multitude of preſſures and oppreſſions, and they tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port all manner of men with paſſion; the oppreſſed cry, they make much ado, when they ſuffer, againſt them, under whom they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer: But few or none are ſo wiſe, in ſuch a caſe, as to recollect themſelves, and make ſerious application to God, putting him in mind of his own gracious nature towards the work of his hands, to have mercy upon it, and in faith to ſeek to him for remedy and comfort, as being only able to relieve and glad the heart in great extremities; they look not to the hand of God, <hi>when they cry out by reaſon of the arme of the mighty:</hi> they only toyle and teare themſelves with complaints, they cry out of this and that man, of this and that inſtrument; but, alas, they find neither redreſs nor deliverance, becauſe they ſay not, <hi>Where is God my maker?</hi> That is, they are more forward to complain of wrong done them by men, than to remember what good, or what favours God hath done them; They do not particularly and ſpecially apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

                  <p>There is one thing further conſiderable in the Grammar of the Text.

                     </gap> text plurally. Firſt, to inſinuate or intimate unto us that Great and glorious myſtery of the Bleſſed Trinity of perſons in the God-head; I ſay, to intimate it, we cannot make a full or convincing proof from it againſt any Antitrinitarian Adverſary; becauſe though the word <hi>Elohim</hi> notes a plurality, yet we cannot by any force of the word, determine that plurality preciſely to a Trinity, that muſt be done by other Scriptures, of which we have an abundant ſtore to ſtop the mouth of all gainſayers. Secondly, they tell us, This plural word is uſed to ſet forth the honour of God, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the uſage of Kings and Soveraigne Princes (called Gods) who ſpeak of themſelves (though ſingle perſons) in a plural ſtile, <hi>We</hi> and <hi>

                  <q>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Many cry and complain in affliction, but look not to God in affliction.</q>

Yea, there are ſome who cry and complain in affliction, yet turn away from God in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, (<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.14.) <hi>They have not cryed unto me with their heart, when they howled upon their beds; they aſſemble themſelves for corne and wine, and they rebell againſt me.</hi> Theſe are ſo far from ſeeking God indeed, or ſaying, <hi>Where is our maker,</hi> with their heart, that they rebell againſt him, while they would be relieved and fed by him. How frequently, even at this day, do ſome men
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:48335:37"/> ſtorme, and fret, and rage, little minding God in their afflictions, though formally or vocally calling on him. 'Tis eaſie to complain, but hard to pray in a day of trouble. The <hi>Jewes</hi> are reproved for their regardleſneſs of God, while they made great preparations in a time of danger and war, or of a feared ſiege, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 22.8, &amp;c.) <hi>Thou didſt look in that day to the armour of the houſe of the forreſt; ye have ſeen alſo the breaches of the City of David, that they are many,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And the houſes have ye broken down to fortifie the wall: Ye made alſo a ditch between the two walls for the water of the old pool,</hi> &amp;c. Here were politick warlike preparations, yea God was little thought upon in all this; as it followeth, (<hi>v.</hi> 11.) <hi>But ye have not looked unto the maker thereof, neither had reſpect unto him that faſhioned it long ago.</hi> 'Tis thus with the moſt of men; when outward miſery comes upon them, what crying? what working is there? yet little returning to God, little turning into their own hearts.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Note.</p>
                  <q>When men oppreſs and vex us, it is beſt to have our recourſe to God, and apply to him.</q>
                  <p>That counſel, <hi>Look to me and be ſaved, (Iſa.</hi> 45.22.) is true of temporal as well as of eternal ſalvation. God is our beſt friend at all times, even in the beſt times, and it is beſt to look to him in the worſt times. <hi>David</hi> could ſay, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.28.) when fleſh, and ſtrength, and heart, when all fayled him; <hi>It is good for me to draw near to God.</hi> Let our condition be what it will, but eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if we are in a bad condition, it is good, yea beſt to go to him who hath our times, that is, all the changes of our condition in his hand, to him, in whoſe hand the arme of the mighty is, and in whoſe hand alone there is might to help and deliver us from the arme of the mighty. Is it not beſt to look to him in affliction, who can either ſupport us in, or bring us out of our affliction as pleaſeth him? He that made us can protect and ſave us; therefore in every pinching ſtrait, in every preſſing danger, let us go to God in faith and hope, and he will either give us enlargements, or do us good by and in our worſt and greateſt ſtraits.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Note.</p>
                  <q>As it is good, when at any time we are in trouble to look to God, ſo we ſhould then look to God, ſpecially under this relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as he is our Maker.</q>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:48335:38"/>
                  <p>It is good then to ſay, God is my maker, and I am the work of his hands, therefore he will take care of me, and deliver me out of the hand of my oppreſſors. There are five duties which ariſe from this Conſideration, that God is our Maker. Firſt, We ſhould highly eſteem and be thankfull for this benefit, our making. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, We ſhould be confident that he who hath made us will preſerve us. Thirdly, We ſhould patiently ſubmit to him, when he afflicteth us himſelf, or ſuffers others to afflict us. Fourthly, We ſhould give him glory, by believing that he will take care of us in, or deliver us out of all our ſufferings and afflictions. Fifthly, We ſhould not think nor ſpeak hardly of God, becauſe he hath made us ſubject to tryals, and the exerciſe of patience; neither ſhould we take it ill, that he hath made others ſo high or great, that they have power to oppreſs us. In all theſe reſpects, we ſhould look to God our maker, and neither murmure at, nor be afraid in a day of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ffliction. The Lord himſelf poynts us to that, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.12, 13.) <hi>Who art thou that thou ſhouldeſt be afraid of a man that ſhall dye, and of the ſon of man which ſhall be made as graſſe, and forgetteſt the Lord thy maker?</hi> It is good in time of affliction to remember God in all our relations, and in this, as our <hi>maker,</hi> in a three-fold making of us. Firſt, As our maker in a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural capacity, that is, as he hath made theſe bodies of ours; we may plead with and urge the Lord to take care of and preſerve our bodyes, becauſe he ha h made them; preſervation is an act of providence, and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ovidence followeth creation. Secondly, As our maker in a civil capacity, that is, as he hath made us rich or poor, high or low in the world, or in any worldly enjoyments. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> that great Dragon, lying in the midſt of the rivers, ſaid, (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 29.3.) <hi>My river is mine own, and I have made it for my ſelf.</hi> But grace teacheth us to ſay otherwiſe; if we are rich or ſtrong, God hath made us ſo; if our river be broad and deep, full and over-flowing, God hath made it ſo; and if we are poor, and weak, if our river be na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>row and ſhallow, empty and dry, God hath made it ſo; and who ſhall ſay to him, Why haſt thou made it ſo? That God is the maker of our croſſe, ſhould make us quiet under it. Thirdly, A godly man ſhould look to God in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as his maker in a ſpiritual capacity; I do not mean as he hath made our ſpirits, but as he hath made us ſpiritual, or as we are his <hi>workmanſhip,</hi> (that's the Apoſtles word) <hi>created in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:48335:38"/> unto good works,</hi> (Eph. 2.10.) That we are thus wrought, works much upon the heart of God in the day of our affliction. That God hath made us men, that we are his creatures, is a good argument, a faire plea, and moves much; but that he hath made us new men, or new creatures, his Sons by grace, and Temples of his Spirit, that he hath made us holy, believing, righteous, is a far ſtronger argument, a ſuller plea, and moves much more. A ſoul that can go to God thus, and tell him he is his maker; a ſoul that can ſay, (as 'tis ſaid of the Church, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.5.) <hi>My maker is my husband;</hi> He that made me, hath married me to himſelf; a ſoul that can ſay this, may indeed triumph in and over all his tribulations. How ſweet is it to have an intereſt in Chriſt, and by him a relation to God as our maker in this reſpect. When the Lord rejects a people to the utmoſt, he ſaith he will not be ſtayd, no not by this relation as their maker, from doing it, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.11.) <hi>This is a people of no underſtanding; therefore he that made them will not have mercy on them, and he that formed them will ſhew them no favour.</hi> As if the Prophet had ſaid, If any argument could move the Lord to ſhew mercy, this would do it, to tell him, <hi>he hath made ſuch a people,</hi> or, <hi>he is their maker.</hi> But there are none whom the Lord hath made in the third ſenſe, as to a new creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but he will have mercy on them, and ſhew them favour; his making of them ſuch, is a g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eater mercy and an higher favour, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n any they can ask of him; nor are there any of that making, who are of no underſtanding. So then, he that is made of God ſpiritually, needs not care for all the unmaking or undoing he can receive from men, nor fear that he ſhall ever be unmade or unmercy'd by God. All he can loſe in this world, doth not, cannot make him miſerable, who is made fit for the world to come: He knoweth he hath an eſtate ſetled upon him by his Maker, which cannot be taken away. A man thus made, may ſay to his ſpoylers, Ye have taken nothing from me but the ſcraps and ſweepings, the parings and chippings of my eſtate: The Archers indeed have ſorely grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me, and ſhot at me, but my bow abides in ſtrength, and the armes of my hands are made ſtrong by the hands of the mighty God of <hi>Jacob.</hi> He that is ſpiritually made, or made a new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is made for ever, and in every ſtrait he may look to God his Maker, as a helper and reſtorer. He that made us when we were nothing, can help us when we are reduced to a very no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:48335:39"/> It is an encouragement to go to God for healing, becauſe he hath wounded us; <hi>Come, and let us return unto the Lord,</hi> (ſaith the Church) <hi>for he hath torne, and he will heale us, he hath ſmitten, and he will bind us up,</hi> (Hoſ. 6.1.) Much more is it an encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to go unto God to be our healer, becauſe he hath been our Maker. He that hath made us, can mend us; He that built us, can repaire us, if we ſay, as we ought, and have been taught, <hi>Where is God our maker?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>Who giveth ſongs in the night.</q>
                  <p>Thoſe words contain a ſecond Conſideration, why the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſhould ſeek to God; he <hi>giveth ſongs,</hi> that is, matter of ſongs, or cauſe of ſinging, joy and comfort, even in the night. There are ſeveral opinions about the meaning of theſe words. Some (as I ſhewed before) interpret this verſe of the oppreſſors; <hi>None (of them) ſay, Where is God my maker, who giveth ſongs in the night?</hi> So the words are a deſcription, as of the great worldly ſecurity, ſo of the great worldly felicity of thoſe oppreſſors. Poor men la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour all day hard, and being wearied out with their labours, when night cometh they go to bed; But prophane great and rich men, idle away the day, and ſport and play and ſing away the night. As good men have holy ſongs in the night, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.29.) <hi>Ye ſhall have a ſong as in the night, when a holy Solemnity is kept,</hi> &amp;c. So the wicked have their wanton, vaine, revelling ſongs in the night, when their ſenſual Solemnities are kept. <hi>Belſhazer</hi> was drinking in the night, and doubtleſs, he had his muſick &amp; ſongs that night: And as he had his ſongs, mirth, and muſick in the night, ſo he ſaid not <hi>Where is God my maker, who giveth me ſongs in the night:</hi> he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of minding God his maker in his mirth, minded only the gods which himſelf had made (as the text ſpeaks, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.4.) <hi>They drank wine, and praiſed the gods of gold and of ſilver,</hi> &amp;c. And thus 'tis in proportion with all the wicked to whom God gives ſongs in the night, they ſay not, <hi>Where is God my maker?</hi> This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation which carrieth the ſongs to the oppreſſors before ſpoken of, contains a truth, yet I ſhall not ſtay upon it, but take the words as referring to the oppreſſed.</p>
                  <p>Here it may be queried, how doth God give them ſongs in the night? I ſhall not inſiſt upon thoſe conjectures, which ſome have made about this <hi>giving ſongs in the night.</hi> As Firſt, implying God
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:48335:39"/> ſo gracious, that he giveth us not only in the day, but in the night, occaſion of joy in ſorrow, namely, the view and contemplation of the Heavens and Starrs, which are very pleaſant and refreſhing, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.1.)</p>
                  <p>Others, Secondly, conjecture, that God may be ſaid to give the ſorrowful and oppreſſed ones ſongs in the night, by the ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of birds in the night, of that bird eſpecially which hath its name from ſinging in the night, <hi>the Nightingal.</hi> Some inſiſt much upon theſe interpretations. It is, I grant, a great mercy of God that when the Sun is down, we have Moon-light and Star-light, and that in the night we have the innocent harmleſs birds to ſing and make us pleaſant melody. But leaving theſe, we may take the words in a double notion; Firſt, Properly; Secondly, Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorically.</p>
                  <p>Properly, and ſo <hi>to give ſongs in the night,</hi> as the night is taken for night time, imports the goodneſs of God to man, not only in the day time, but in the night.</p>

                  <q>God by his good Spirit doth often ſuggeſt ſweet meditations and comfortable thoughts to his people in the night.</q>
                  <p>In the night the Lord minds his ſervants either of ſuch mercies as they have already received, or of ſuch, as according to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, he is ready to, or will ſurely beſtow, that ſo they may be buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that heavenly work of praiſing him, and rejoycing in him, when they awake or cannot ſleep.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſs of God to me in the day. The experience of <hi>Aſaph,</hi> or of <hi>David,</hi> communicated in that Pſalm to <hi>Aſaph,</hi> gives further proof of this, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.6.) where having ſaid, (<hi>v.</hi> 1.) <hi>I cryed unto God with my voyce, and he gave eare unto me:</hi> he adds, (<hi>v.</hi> 6.) <hi>I call to remembrance my ſong in the night;</hi> that is, thoſe occaſions of joy and ſinging which God hath heretofore given me: Theſe ſongs were ſweeter
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48335:40"/> to me than ſleep. As it ſheweth an excellent frame of ſpirit to remember the Commandments of God in the night, which <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> alſo profeſſed as his practiſe, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.55.) <hi>I have remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred thy Name, O Lord, in the night, and have kept thy Law.</hi> The name of God is any manifeſtation of God, either in his word or works. And again, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.62.) <hi>At midnight I will riſe to give thanks to thee, becauſe of thy righteous judgements.</hi> Some watch in the night to give thanks, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 134.1.) others give thanks when they wake at any time in the night; both are acts of pureſt love to God, and proceed from pureſt conſolation in God. (Cant. 3.1.) <hi>By night on my bed I ſought him.</hi> The Spouſe doth not ſay only, <hi>by night I ſought him,</hi> but <hi>by night on my bed,</hi> I ſpend not the night in ſleeping, but in ſeeking him whom my ſoul loveth. (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.7.) <hi>My reines inſtruct me in the night ſeaſon;</hi> That is, I have as it were diſcourſes and ſoliloquies, ſecret debates about, and ſtrong deſires after the things of God, even in the night. <hi>That ſoul is indeed awake to God, which is acquainted with and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to theſe divine ſongs in the night, the time of ſleep.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Further, Take the word <hi>night</hi> in a metaphorical notion, as night ſignifieth a troubleſome ſtate; God may be ſaid <hi>to give ſongs in the night,</hi> when he comforts us in or at any time of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction. I need not ſtay to prove that in Scripture the night is put for affliction, nor need I prove, that, to give inward joy in a day of outward ſorrow, is to give ſongs in the night. The obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation riſing from this metaphorical underſtanding of night, is this, which the Scripture and experience are full of.</p>
                  <q>God ſends comfort to his people, or cauſeth them to rejoyce in the midſt of their afflictions.</q>
                  <p>It is the Apoſtles deſcription of God, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.3, 4.) <hi>The God of all comfort, who comforteth us in all our tribulation.</hi> What ſweet ſongs have ſuffering Saints ſound in the darkeſt midnight of their affliction! What inward peace in outward troubles! What ſoul freedome in bodily reſtraint!<note place="margin">Carmen in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cte eſt laetitia in tribulatione. <hi>Greg:</hi>
                     </note> One of the Ancients hath put the queſtion, and anſwered it. <hi>What's a ſong in the night? 'Tis joy in time of trouble.</hi> Whenever God gives a ſoul joy in time of trouble, he gives a ſong in the night. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Sylas</hi> ſang in the night, in both notions of night. If we take night in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſenſe, they ſang in the night, and in an improper ſenſe, they
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:48335:41"/> were in priſon, that was a night of affliction to them, yea it was midnight with them, the power of darkneſs, or the darkeſt out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward affliction to them, yet, ſaith the Text, <hi>At midnight Paul and Sylas ſang:</hi> They had ſongs in their mouths, and in their hearts too; they ſang ſo loud that all heard them. And hence we may collect the ſtrength of the argument or reaſon upon which <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihu</hi> here ſaith, God doth not regard the cry of many under op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, they make a noyſe, but none ſaith, <hi>Where is God my ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, who giveth ſongs in the night,</hi> who is able to comfort us in all our afflictions, who is able to make darkneſs light to us, and turn our ſorrows into ſongs of joy; they had not theſe high thoughts of God, not theſe holy confidences in God, while they lay under the oppreſſions of men, and therefore God did not regard their cry, nor ſave them from the arme of the mighty. This is the firſt part of the anſwer which <hi>Elihu</hi> made to <hi>Jobs</hi> complaint, that the oppreſſed were not delivered, though being preſſed ſo ſorely they could not forbeare to cry, yea to cry out in their miſery.

We may learn much in the School of thoſe creatures who have not only no learning, but no underſtanding, and may be ſtirred up to the exerciſe of excellent vertues, by thoſe which have not the exerciſe of reaſon. The Scripture ſendeth man, the higheſt of viſible creatures, to the loweſt of viſible creatures, to creatures ſo little, that they are ſcarce viſible, for inſtruction; <hi>Go to the Ant thou ſluggard, conſider her wayes, and be wiſe,</hi> (Pro. 6.6.) There are ſeveral obſervable qualities, and, as I may call them, vertues, not only in the beaſts of the earth, and fowls of the air, but in the meaneſt creeping things, which are very imitable by man; and thus God doth teach us by the beaſts of the earth, and by the fowls of the air, vertually, though not formally, by their practiſe and example, though not by their precepts or rules; for ſuch teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings neither the beaſts of the earth nor the fowls of the air have any competency at all.

                        </gap>ſdome (ſuch as it is) that the Beaſts of the Earth, and Fowls of the Air have, is of God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>If he <hi>teacheth men more than the Beaſts of the earth, and maketh them wiſer than the Fowls of the Air,</hi> then in ſome way and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure he teacheth them, and maketh them wiſe. That wiſdome and knowledge, whatſoever it is, which Beaſts and Fowls have, is planted in them by God; they have that which ſerves their
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48335:43"/> turn, and anſwers their ſtate, by a common inſtinct of nature, which man hath anſwerable to his ſtate, either by immediate Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or by means of inſtruction from God. So then, Beaſts and Birds receive their peculiar qualities and abilities from God, as well as their Being: And God hath beſtowed thoſe qualities, which are ſhadows of wiſdome and underſtanding, upon Beaſts and Birds, not only for their own preſervation, but for the benefit of man, that they may be more uſeful to him, and fitter for his ſervice. As God hath made both Man and Beaſt for himſelf, ſo he hath made the Beaſts of the Earth, and Fowls of the Air for Man, either to ſerve mans neceſſity, or to procure his honeſt delight: And that they might reach both theſe ends, he hath furniſhed them accordingly. A creature which hath not ſomwhat in it like Reaſon, could be little made uſe of by the Reaſon of Man.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Note;
<q>Man is far better taught, than either the Beaſts of the Earth, or Fowls of the Air.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Man, as Man, hath that in him, which wonderfully exceeds the Beaſts of the Earth and Fowls of the Air; he hath Reaſon in him, which they have not; he is a reaſonable creature, which they are not, and ſo can do that which they cannot. Man, by the power of Reaſon is able, firſt, to propoſe to himſelf an end in what he doth; ſecondly, to chuſe fit means for the attaining of that end; neither of which Beaſts can do. And if any man be without wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to propoſe to himſelf a right end, and to chuſe due means lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ding thereunto, there's little difference between that man and a beaſt, ſurely all his wiſdome is but brutiſh. Further, God hath not only given Man a ſenſe of thoſe things which are hurtful to him, as he hath to the Beaſts of the Earth and Fowls of the Air; but God hath given Man an Underſtanding, by which, he knowing God, may worſhip him, by which alſo he may ſee into and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee the cauſes of things, and likewiſe rightly apply known means, either to prevent or remedy evils, and to bring about that which is good. Again, as God hath beſtowed that wonderful bleſſing of Reaſon upon Man, above Beaſts and Fowls, which makes him ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of higher inſtructions and fruitions, than either of them; ſo God hath provided higher and better means for the inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Man, than he hath for the inſtruction of Beaſts. <hi>He teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us more.</hi> For,</p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:48335:44"/>
                  <p>Firſt, He hath given his Word to Man, not to Beaſts; he hath not made a Bible for the Beaſt of the Earth, and the Fowls of the Air; but for Man he hath, that he might both know his will and do it, know his favour or good will to him, and enjoy it. Secondly, He hath given ſome men his Spirit; he hath not beſtowed his Spirit upon any Beaſts, nor upon any Fowls of the Air: and becauſe his Spirit teacheth us, we are ſaid to be taught of God, eminently taught of God. Thirdly, he hath given us his Ordinances, and appointed Officers, or ſet perſons in Office, to mannage and hold out thoſe Ordinances, wherein himſelf is both honoured and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed. <hi>He</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11, 12.) <hi>gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets, and ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome Paſtors and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers; for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtry, for the edifying of the Body of Chriſt,</hi> for the bringing in, and build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of ſouls. <hi>He ſheweth his Word unto Jacob, his Statutes and Judgments unto Iſrael,</hi> (Pſal. 147.19.) and as it follows in the next verſe of the ſame <hi>Pſalm, He hath not dealt ſo with any Nation,</hi> as with his <hi>Iſrael,</hi> his Church, to be ſure he hath not dealt ſo with the Beaſts of the Earth, nor with the Fowls of the Air, as was ſhewed alſo in opening the Text.</p>
                  <p>Further as to the matter in queſtion about the Providences and dealings of God with man; God hath taught Man much more than Beaſts: As Firſt, That all things which befall us, come from, and are ordered by himſelf. Secondly, That we ought to receive the Rule and take inſtruction from God, how to behave our ſelves under his various dealings. Thirdly, He hath taught us at all times, and in all turns of Providence, to ſtay our ſelves in waiting upon him, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.7.) Fourthly, He hath taught us in times of trouble and affliction, to cry to him, and call upon him as his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in faith, not barely to complain, much leſs to be impatiently outragious like Beaſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</p>
                  <p>Now if God hath taught us more than the Beaſts, then, we ſhould not live by ſenſe, nor purſue ſenſible things, as Beaſts do, but aſpire to and ſeek after union and communion with God, whom the beaſts of the earth know not. How greatly will this aggravate the ſin of man, if having been taught more than beaſts, any man ſhould be found to have learned leſs than beaſts; as will appear yet more in the next obſervation but one.</p>

                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Elihu</hi> at leaſt intimates this Note;
<q>Men ſometimes act but as, or indeed below, the very beaſts of the earth, and the fowls of the air:</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>For (ſaith he) they ſay not, <hi>Where is God our maker, who gives us ſongs in the night? who teacheth us better,</hi> or more, <hi>than the beaſts of the earth.</hi> As if he had ſaid,<note place="margin">In extremam ſtultitiae meam incidimus, ſi ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pientiores nos eo putemu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, qui ſapientes nos facit.</note> The beaſts of the earth anſwer the inſtinct of nature, (which is all the coſt God beſtows in teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them) better than men do thoſe coſtly teachings and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions which God beſtows upon them by his Word, by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, by his Miniſters, by his Ordinances, and by his Providences; for all theſe wayes doth the Lord teach and inſtruct men from day to day; yet men often act, not only beſide and below, but quite contrary to all theſe teachings. The beaſts of the earth keep up to the inſtruction which they have received, the inſtinct of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they move according to that; but man who hath an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, doth not alwayes move ſuitably to his underſtanding; man hath reaſon, yet he doth not alwayes regulate his motions by reaſon, but is hurried by paſſion, or led by ſenſe, as a beaſt. (<hi>Pſal</hi> 49.20.) <hi>Man that is in honour, and underſtandeth not, is like the beaſts that periſh;</hi> that is, though his ſtate and ſpheare be higher than a beaſt, yet he moves by as low a principle as a beaſt, even by ſenſe, or ſenſual appetite, either irraſcible, or concupiſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as a beaſt doth. By the man in honour, that underſtandeth not, the Pſalmiſt intends not a fool that hath no underſtanding, nor an Idiot that hath no uſe of reaſon, but he is ſaid not to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, becauſe he doth not uſe his underſtanding; as he in the Parable that did not uſe his Talent, is ſaid to have none, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 25.29.) Underſtanding is a Talent, and a great one, a choyce one too. A man that hath the greateſt natural underſtanding and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, yea poſſibly the greateſt learning, and experience, may be ſaid, <hi>not to underſtand,</hi> when he doth not behave himſelf under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandingly, or according to the Lawes and Rules of reaſon.

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:48335:45"/> inability, that is, they live as if they had nothing, but (what beaſts have) ſenſe and appetite to govern their lives by. He that doth not practiſe according to knowledge what he knows, is like, and worſe than a beaſt that hath no knowledge. For when a beaſt doth any thing abſurdly, he doth like a beaſt; but when man doth any thing abſurdly, he degenerates or falleth from his own forme, he doth not like a man, and therefore is worſe than a beaſt. And that's it, I conceive, which the Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> aimes at in the 10th verſe of his Epiſtle, where rebuking a very vile generation of men, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilers, who ſpeak evil of thoſe things which they know not;</hi> he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently adds, <hi>But what they know naturally as brute-beaſts, in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſe things they corrupt themſelves.</hi> When he ſaith, <hi>What they know na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally as brute-beaſts,</hi> his meaning is, what they know in common with beaſts, that is, by ſenſe and appetite, which are common to man and beaſt, (as reaſon and underſtanding are common to Man and Angel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>:) Now (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>what they know naturally as brute beaſts, in thoſe things they corrupt themſelves,</hi> which brute beaſts do not. For theſe words, <hi>as brute beaſts,</hi> are to be taken in conſtruction and interpretation, with the former part of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, <hi>What they know naturally,</hi> not with the latter, <hi>they corrupt themſelves.</hi> Their knowledge indeed is no better than the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of brute beaſts, natural, but in corrupting themſelves they are unlike to, and do worſe than brute beaſts, who run not to ſuch exceſſes; yet there is nothing more common in Scripture, than to ſay that men act the beaſt, when they ſin, and put off thoſe manners which become and are worthy of an ingenuous and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional man. For as man is partaker both of a ſpiritual and ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive nature, ſo he takes his denomination from that part to which in his diſpoſition and converſation he moſt inclines: Hence he is ſometimes called <hi>God,</hi> or an <hi>Angel of God,</hi> and ſometimes he is compared to the moſt hurtful of beaſts, a Lyon, ſometimes to the worſt of beaſts, to a Fox, to a Wolfe, to a Dog, to a Swine, to a generation of Vipers, to what not, which may put a mark of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhonour and reproach upon him.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Note;
<q>It's a great ſhame, reproof, and reproach to man, when he acts unanſwerably to the teachings of God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is better to be a beaſt in or by nature, than to be a beaſt (and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:48335:45"/> continue ſo) in qualities and conditions. O what a reproach is it, that they who have a far better nature than beaſts, ſhould lead no better lives than a beaſt, yea poſſibly much worſe! The Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt crys ſhame upon ſuch (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.9.) <hi>Be ye not as the Horſe, or as the Mule, which have no underſtanding, whoſe mouth muſt be held in with bit and bridle, leſt they come near unto thee.</hi> The Horſe and Mule are unruly creatures, if left to their own rule, they have no underſtanding how to mannage and order themſelves; they muſt be mannaged and order'd by bit and bridle in the hand of a skilful rider, elſe they do more hurt than good ſervice to thoſe that come near them: Now, ſaith the Lord to man, Be not you like the untaught or unmannag'd Horſe and Mule; as ye are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter taught, ſo ye ſhould have better manners. We ſay of ſome men, they are better fed than taught; and we may ſay of many men, they are better taught than manner'd; they mend not their manners, though daily taught, yea urged to mend them. For this neglect the Lord reproves the ſluggard, (<hi>Pro.</hi> 6.6.) <hi>Go to the Ant thou ſluggard, conſider her wayes, and be wiſe;</hi> thou doeſt not anſwer natural, much leſs Scriptural light, thou doeſt not learn by any teachings; one of the leaſt of my creatures may teach thee more than thou haſt yet learned of all the teachers which I have ſent thee. The little Ant that dwels upon a Mole-hil, that creeps upon the ground, may teach thee better manners, and make thee wiſer. Art thou not aſhamed to need ſuch a teacher, having had ſo many teachers? That's alſo the ſenſe of thoſe rebukes which the Prophet powres out (with a ſtrong conteſtation) upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> calling Heaven and Earth to witneſs againſt them, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.2.) <hi>Hear O Heavens, and give ear O Earth, I have nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, and brought up children, and they have rebelled againſt me.</hi> But how doth the Lord convict them of rebellion, and by whom? even by the teachableneſs and trac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Theſe beaſts take notice of, regard and ſubmit to their Maſter and Benefactor: but <hi>Iſrael</hi> doth neither obſerve nor ſubmit to me, who have tenderly nurſed and plentifully nouriſhed them; who have (as the Lord ſpake by his Prophet, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.4.) <hi>been to

As the Lord thus rebukes the head-ſtrong obſtinacy and wilfulneſs of that people, by their likeneſs to the Horſe; ſo in the next verſe he reproves their blindneſs and blockiſhneſs, by their unlikeneſs to the Sto k, &amp;c. <hi>Yea the Stork in the Heaven knoweth her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted time, and the Turtle, and the Crane, and the Swallow ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the time of their coming, but my people know not the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Lord.</hi> Then followeth, (<hi>v.</hi> 8.) <hi>How do ye ſay, we are wiſe, and the Law of the Lord is with us; Lo certainly in vaine made he it, the pen of the Scribe is in vaine:</hi> As if he had ſaid; You have been taught, you have had the Law of the Lord, and you a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Both God and Men ſhall hear of them: <hi>There they cry.</hi> An af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted condition, is a complaining condition; Nature being pinch't will ſpeak. <hi>I</hi> (ſaid <hi>Job,</hi> Chap. 7.11.) <hi>will not refraine my mouth, I will ſpeak in the anguiſh of my heart, I will complain in the bitterneſs of my ſoul.

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:48335:47"/> (Pſal.</hi> 55.2.) The title of the 102<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Pſalm runs thus; <hi>A prayer of the afflicted when he is overwhelmed, and powreth out his complaint before God.</hi>

                  <p>Note;
<q>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Some in their afflictions do nothing but cry, nothing but complain.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Elihu</hi> doth not ſay, There they repent, and there they hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themſelves, and there they turn to God, but <hi>there they cry;</hi> that they are troubled is the all, the only thing that troubles them. 'Tis ſaid before, <hi>God teacheth man more than the beaſts of the Earth;</hi> but many in a day of affliction, do no more than the Beaſts of the Earth. A Beaſt, when hurt, will cry, he will rage and roare; and that's as much as many men do when they are hurt, though God hath taught them more, many leſſons more, which they ſhould be practiſing under ſorrowful diſpenſations. The Ox loweth, and is taught no more, when he wants fodder, the Aſs brayeth, and is taught no more, when he wants graſſe; but man is taught to act repentance, and faith, and patience, and ſubmiſſion to the will of God in want. How ſad is it when we hear nothing but fleſh cry in man, or when nothing is cryed for by man but fleſh, that is, the ſupplyes of Nature, in the day of his diſtreſs. As 'tis ſaid of thoſe (<hi>Hoſea</hi> 7.14.) <hi>They have not cryed unto me with their heart, when they howled upon their beds; they aſſemble themſelves for corn, and for wine, and they rebel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me.</hi> How miſerable are they in their miſeries, whoſe tongues cry to God, but not their hearts, or their hearts being ſilent; who cry for corne and wine, not for grace and repentance, or not for grace to repent; who cry much becauſe they ſuffer e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, but not at all becauſe they have done evil, yea who are doing evil at the very time when they are crying out becauſe of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils which they ſuffer: Such was the wretched frame of thoſe in the Prophet; <hi>They aſſembled themſelves for corne and for wine, and rebelled againſt God.</hi> 'Tis bad enough, when there is crying, and nothing but crying, this is to cry but as beaſts cry; but to cry and rebel againſt God, is to be worſe than beaſts, for beaſts do not rebel againſt God when they are pinched with want, and cry. It is ſad to be in afflictions; to be put to cry in afflictions is more ſad; only to cry for the affliction is yet more ſad, when nothing
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:48335:48"/> comes from a man but a cry, there is nothing in the cryer, but what is meerly of man; but to be found ſinning againſt God, while we a e crying out in our affliction is moſt ſad, that's the ſaddeſt and worſt condition of man in affliction. The Lord teacheth his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple better, let us ſhew our ſelves better taught, than only to cry in our afflictions; and let it be the abhorrence of our ſouls for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to ſin at all, much more to ſin up to rebellion againſt God in our affliction, that it ſhould be ſaid of any of us as of that wicked King <hi>Ahaz,</hi> (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.22.) that in the time of any diſtreſs, we have treſpaſſed more againſt the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Whereas thoſe oppreſſed ones cryed, yet (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſecond interpretation) continued proud and naught.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve,
<q>The greateſt oppreſſion and worldly trouble, cannot break the power of ſin, nor bring down the proud heart of man.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither oppreſſion from man, nor affliction from God, can break the pride of mans ſpirit. Theſe were oppreſſed, yet proud ſtill. Our eſtates may be broken, our relations broken, our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts broken, yet our hearts remain unbroken. The oppreſſed are many times, as proud as their oppreſſors, and they who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly dealt with, are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s bad as they that deale unjuſtly with them. Oppreſſors (though not all who oppreſs) are alwayes bad, and the oppreſſed are many times ſo too, even as bad as their oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors. There is no proof of any mans grace or goodneſs by this, that he is oppreſſed, or wronged; for he may be wronged, and ground to powder with oppreſſion, yet his heart as hard as a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Milſtone, and his ſpirit as high, and as much lifted up as <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifers.</hi> There is nothing in affliction, trouble, or oppreſſion, that can humble the heart of man; the Spirit of God, God himſelf muſt do it. Outward changes work no inward change; we may be emptied from veſſel to veſſel, from one condition to another, yet have our ſin-ſent remaining in us. It was, indeed, ſaid of <hi>Moab, (Jer.</hi> 48.11.) <hi>He hath not been emptied from veſſel to veſſel, neither hath he gone into captivity,</hi> (that is, he hath not been troubled much in his own Land, nor carried into ſtrange Lands, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> hath been) <hi>therefore his taſt remained in him, and his ſent is not changed;</hi> that is, as he ſtill retains his civil ſtate and ſtrength, ſo his ſpiritual vanity, impiety, and impurity, even as Wines that
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:48335:48"/> have not been drawn off the Lees, and put into other Cask, (to that the Scripture there alludes) retain their firſt taſt and ſent or ſmel, and are not meliorated or made more fit for the palat and ſtomack of thoſe that drink them. Now (I ſay) as many for want of changes or afflictions, are not mended, ſo ſome mend not though they have many changes and afflictions; nor can any thing or affliction mend us, or work a change of heart and life in us, unleſſe grace work with it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Whereas it is ſaid, <hi>they cry, but none giveth anſwer,</hi> God doth not hear and anſwer them;</p>
                  <p>Note;
<q>The crys of proud, or bad men, how much ſoever they are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, do not move God, nor will he anſwer them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is no reaſon he ſhould anſwer their cry, (though they have reaſon enough to cry) who will not anſwer his call, his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; let ſuch cry and cry, tear the air, and rend their throats with crying, they ſhall not be anſwered. <hi>Job</hi> ſaith of the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, (<hi>Chap.</hi> 27.9.) <hi>Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him?</hi> No, he will not. <hi>Solomon</hi> leaves the contemners of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms counſel under the ſame doom, (<hi>Pro.</hi> 1.28.) <hi>Then ſhall they call, but I will not anſwer; they ſhall ſeek me early, but they ſhall not find me.</hi> But when was this <hi>Then</hi> in which they called, and the Lord would not anſwer? The 27<hi rend="sup">t</hi>h verſe tells us, The <hi>when</hi> or time of this rejection, it was when they had moſt need of hearing and acceptation, even when their feare (that is, the thing feared, or at leaſt which made them afraid) came upon them, as deſolation, and <hi>their deſtruction as a whirlwind;</hi> when thoſe ſad Meſſengers came they ſought God <hi>early,</hi> that is, earneſtly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently, but could not find him: But what was the reaſon of this refuſal? <hi>They hated knowledge, and did not chuſe the fear of the Lord,</hi> (v. 29.) They had been wicked, and nought, before trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble came, and when trouble was come they were no better, therefore the Lord regarded not either their perſons or their cryes. <hi>The Lord</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle preaching to the <hi>Athenians, Acts</hi> 17.27.) <hi>is not far from every one of us;</hi> yet 'tis ſaid (<hi>Pro.</hi> 15.29.) <hi>The Lord is far from the wicked, but he heareth the prayer of the righteous:</hi> He is far, that is, far from hearing and anſwering, far from helping and relieving the wicked when they pray. The
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:48335:49"/> Lord is not far from any of us as men, <hi>for in him we live, move, and have our being,</hi> (v. 28.) <hi>and he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things,</hi> for the ſupport of life and natural being; but he is far from all proud men, as to any complacency in their perſons, and as to the hearing of their prayers. He is far from hearing them, and he knows them a far off, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 138.6.) that is, he deals with th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m as with men at a diſtance. Thus the Lord told the impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents among his own people by the Prophet, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.15.) <hi>Though you make many prayers, I will not hear, for your hands are full of blood.</hi> Ye are full of bloody ſins, and ye have not humbled your ſelves, nor cleanſed your hearts and hands by the blood of the Covenant to this day; and being in that caſe, you may cry and pray till your hearts ake, and your tongues ake too, yet no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing with God, no grant, no hearing. Another Prophet tells them as ſad newes from the Lord, (<hi>Jer.</hi> 11.11.) <hi>Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they ſhall not be able to eſcape,</hi> (or, <hi>go forth of) and though they ſhall cry unto me, I will not hearken to them.</hi> Though the Lord threatned, <hi>I will bring ſuch evil upon them, that they ſhall not eſcape;</hi> they might ſay, well, but when the evil hath taken hold of us, we hope God will hear us, and deliver us. No, ſaith God, when the evil hath overtaken and arreſted you, yet your prayers ſhall not overtake me; <hi>Though you cry, yet I will not hearken unto you.</hi> That's a dreadful Scripture of the ſame im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.41.) <hi>They cryed, but there was none to ſave them: even unto the Lord, but he anſwered them not.</hi> They cryed being in great diſtreſſe, and they cryed to the Lord; he brings in that, leſt any ſhould ſay, they cryed indeed, but poſſibly 'twas to falſe gods, to idols, poſſibly they knockt at a wrong doore, and ſo were not heard: No, they cryed to the Lord, to the Lord by name; they were right as to the object of prayer, but their hearts were not right; they were not right ſubjects of prayer. That once blind man ſaw this truth, when anſwering the Phariſees about the perſon by whoſe power he received his ſight, he told them plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, (<hi>Joh.</hi> 9.31.) <hi>We know that God heareth not ſinners;</hi> that is, <hi>Such as love and live in ſin, ſuch as go on impenitently in their ſins.</hi> By this anſwer he cloſely, but ſtrongly confuted that blaſphemous opinion and cenſure of the Phariſees, who reputed and reported the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who came into the world to ſave ſinners, as one of the vileſt ſinners in the world, and upon that account
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48335:49"/> got him crucified at laſt. As if the man had ſaid, Were he that cured me of my blindneſs ſuch a ſinner as you reckon him to be, he could never have obtained power from God to cure me of my blindneſs, <hi>for we know God heareth not ſinners.</hi> When men ſin and pray as it were by turns, their prayers are turned into ſin, and therefore will not be returned in mercy. God ſometimes hears ſinners in wrath and judgement, and he ſometimes will rot hear Saints, as to the grant of the thing in hand prayed for, in love and mercy; but he never denies praying Saints in wrath, nor doth he ever hear a ſinner (ſuch a one as is here intended) in mercy when he prayeth.</p>
                  <p>Now, as when the Diſciples heard Chriſts anſwer to the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees queſtion about Divorce, they preſently ſaid, (<hi>Math.</hi> 19.10.) <hi>If the caſe of the man be ſo with his wife, it is not good to marry;</hi> ſo ſome hearing this doctrine, that God heareth not proud ſinners when they cry or pray, may poſſibly ſay, if the caſe of the proud be thus with God, it is not good for them to pray at all. To ſuch I anſwer, this doctrine is not urged to make proud or impenitent ſinners to leave praying, but to leave their pride, 'tis urged to make them humble under their oppreſſions and afflictions, not to make them prophane. They who (as they are) cannot get by prayer, certainly they cannot get by caſting off prayer. What an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer can they have who cry not at all to God, when ſome may cry and get no anſwer! as <hi>Elihu</hi> here ſpeaks, <hi>There they cry, but none giveth anſwer, becauſe of the pride of wicked men.</hi> This ſenſe or interpretation moſt inſiſted upon in this 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear more full and faire in opening the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>,<note place="margin">Ad dicti ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioris confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mationem Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonemaris vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce ſubjicit.</note> in which <hi>Elihu</hi> brings down what he ſaid here into a ſtrong and peremptory concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; or the next verſe renders another reaſon why God would not relieve thoſe oppreſſed ones, It was not only for the pride of their ſpirits, (<hi>v.</hi> 12.) but alſo for the emptineſs and heartleſneſs of their prayers; or becauſe the prayers of proud and evil men are heartleſs or empty.</p>

So here, <hi>God will not hear vanity,</hi> that is, vaine men, or men that pray vainly; all that, which men ſpeak, or act, is vaine or vanity, if it be not good, if it be not anſwerable to the will and ends of God; yea whatſoever prayer doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from faith, and flow from a pure heart, is vanity, 'tis but ſtraw, and ſtubble, droſs, and dung. <hi>God will not hear vanity,</hi>

                  <p>Hence Note;
<q>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> The prayers of vaine and evil perſons, are vaine things.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Text doth not ſay, their oaths are vaine, and their lies are vaine, and their idle words are vaine, but their cry, their crys in prayer to God are vaine, yea vanity. <hi>There may be vanity in the prayer of a good man, but his prayer is not vanity.</hi> That's a juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof upon the good works of many, which Chriſt gave the Angel of the Church of <hi>Sardis,</hi> (Rev. 3.3.) <hi>I have not found thy works perfect,</hi> or, <hi>I have not found thy works full.</hi> Though that Angel had done good works, and poſſible was full of good works, yet his works were not full. A man may be full of prayer, pray often, yet his prayer not full, his prayers may be empty, vaine prayers; that's a vaine thing which is an empty thing. How vaine are they whoſe beſt things are vanity! If the prayers of a man are vanity, then certainly all is vanity; and we may ſay of him in the whole bulke of all, he is <hi>vanity of vanities, all is vanity.</hi> When once God calls a mans prayer, and hearing, vanity; when he calls thoſe works, which are good for the matter of them, vanity, then the man is indeed altogether vanity. You will ſay, when is prayer vanity, or a vaine thing? I ſhall anſwer it in a few particulars.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That prayer is vaine, or vanity, which is not put up in faith. A faithleſs prayer is a fruitleſs prayer. All the prayers of an unbeliever, or of him who is in a ſtate of unbeliefe are vaine; and the prayers of a believer, that is, who is in his ſtate a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, are vaine, if he hath not faith about that thing for which he prayeth. Now if the prayer of a believer is vaine, when he hath not actual faith, then the prayer of an unbeliever muſt needs be vaine, who hath no habitual faith.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, All the prayers that are for our luſts, or when we reſolve to continue in the practiſe of any luſt, are vaine prayers. When we do not pray with a purpoſe to glorifie God, with what we ſhall obtain by prayer, but only to ſerve our own turns, and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:48335:51"/> ſo beſtow it upon our luſts, that's a vaine prayer, (<hi>James</hi> 4.3.) Such praying is rather a mocking than a worſhiping of God, a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of our ſelves rather than a ſerving of God. How do they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe God in prayer, who cry to him for help, whom they have no mind to honour? who would faine be heard of God, yet have no heart to hear God?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That's a vaine prayer, when we pray meerly to get eaſe, or deliverance from an affliction, not at all minding our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiting by, or the improvement of an affliction. 'Tis not faith in God, but ſenſe of our own ſmart, which moves to pray, when we rather look how to get off our burdens,<note place="margin">Tales clamores non fides, ſed malorum ſenſus extorquer.</note> than out of our ſins, or to get out of the fire, than to get out our droſs; when we pray more to have the plague taken away, than our hard and proud hearts, that is a vaine prayer; 'tis like the prayer of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged that he might be delivered; but it was the plague of God for his ſin, for his hard heart, that troubled him; his hard heart, his ſinning againſt God never troubled him. <hi>Pharaoh</hi>-like prayers, are vaine prayers.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Thoſe prayers are vaine which we make in our own ſtrength. What can thoſe prayers be, which go forth in our ſtrength, ſeeing we are told that we know not what to pray, much leſs then how to pray, but as the Spirit of God helpeth our infirmities, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26.) Unleſſe the Spirit make interceſſion for us, that is, make our interceſſions for us in our hearts, as Chriſt maketh interceſſion for us in heaven, we pray in vaine.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Thoſe are vaine prayers, which we make in our own name, not in the name of Chriſt. And remember, though it be an eaſie matter to name Chriſt in prayer, yet 'tis no eaſie matter to pray in the name of Chriſt. 'Tis as common as that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moneſt, for all ſorts of people, yea for children, to name Chriſt in prayer; but to pray in the name of Chriſt, is the peculiar work of the Spirit in the heart of a true believer. If the Reader deſire to know more diſtinctly what it is to pray in the name of Chriſt, I refer him for ſome help towards it to the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe of the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter, where alſo the requiſites of pure and powerful prayer, are more fully held out.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Angry paſſionate prayers are vaine prayers. The Lord loves zeal and much warmth of affection in prayer, but he cannot abide wrath, or any the leaſt ſparks of paſſion in prayer. The
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:48335:51"/> Apoſtles Rule is, (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.8.) <hi>I will that men pray every where, lifting up pure hands, without wrath, and without doubting.</hi> A peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able heart is as neceſſary in prayer, as a pure hand. When a ſoul coming to God in prayer, hath I know not what wrathful and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry diſputes within himſelf againſt his Brethren, how can he look for a gracious acceptance with God? Will the Lord be pleaſed with us, while we nouriſh ſecret diſpleaſure againſt our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour? Now be ſure when you go to God for mercy and favour, that ye carry no wrath in your ſpirits towards man, one or other; therefore Chriſt hath taught us in that moſt perfect model of prayer, which he hath left us, (when we ask the forgiveneſs of our own treſpaſſes) <hi>to forgive thoſe that treſpaſſe againſt us.</hi> We muſt lay down our unquiet thoughts of revenge, if we would have fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with, and compaſſion from God.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, Thoſe are vain prayers, which are not both formed and matter'd according to the Will of God, (1 <hi>John</hi> 5.14.) which are not grounded upon a juſt cauſe, and which are not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to a right end.

<q>As the Prayers of evil men are vain, ſo they have not any, the leſt regard from God:</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He will neither hear, nor regard. <hi>David</hi> ſaith (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.18.) <hi>If I regard iniquity in my heart, God will not hear my Prayer.</hi> God will not hear a <hi>David,</hi> a good man, as to that particular prayer, if he regard iniquity in his heart, that is, if he hold any, the leaſt complyance or ſecret correſpondence with any ſin, yea, if he hath not repented of, and laboured to mortifie every known ſin: Doubtleſs then he will not regard the prayers of evil men,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:48335:52"/> when they pray alſo with an evil mind. And when this, and other Scriptures ſay, he doth neither hear nor regard them; there is more intended than expreſſed, even that he doth reject and abhor them, that they are a burden and an abomination to him. The Scripture is much in ſhewing how much God makes of holy pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. For firſt, God hath not only promiſed to hear, but regard ſuch prayers, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 112.17.) <hi>He will regard the prayer of the deſtitute, and not deſpiſe their prayers;</hi> that is, he highly prizeth and eſteemeth them. Secondly, The Scripture telleth us, God delighteth to hear ſuch prayers, they are ſweet to him, they are the beſt muſick in his ears; <hi>Let me hear thy voyce, for ſweet is thy voyce</hi> (her prayer-voyce he means chiefly) ſaith Chriſt to his Spouſe, (<hi>Cant.</hi> 2.14.) Thirdly, The Scripture aſſureth us, that God looks upon or reckoneth prayer as an honour done to him, 'tis an eminent part of worſhip, 'tis the giving of him glory; certainly therefore (take prayer purely) God doth regard it very much; he will have regard to that which he hath promiſed regard to, he will have regard to that which is ſweet and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful to him, which is an honour and brings glory to him; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there muſt needs be a great matter in it, when he ſaith, <hi>He will not regard a prayer;</hi> ſuch a prayer muſt needs be very vile, impure, and ſtark naught in it ſelf, which he thus thruſteth from him, or cannot away with.</p>
                  <p>It muſt be confeſſed, that God ſometimes defers to hear (that is, to anſwer) the prayers of thoſe that call upon him in faith, and even their prayers who call upon him humbly and ſincerely. Holy prayers are not alwayes preſently anſwered, but holy prayers are never unregarded, never rejected. 'Tis never ſaid in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, God doth not regard the prayers of a godly man. God may let him ſtay long for the anſwer of his prayer, to try his faith, and patience; but he will not ſlight his prayer. As it is the duty of all men to pray, and the deſire or delight of a godly man, (when his heart is in a right frame) to pray, ſo it is the priviledge of every godly man, that his prayer is heard and regarded. And as it is the ſin of moſt wicked men that they pray not at all, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.4. <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.25.) ſo it is the miſery of all wicked men, that their prayers, though they make many and long prayers, are not heard, are not regarded. They are far from the grace and feare of God, who regard not to pray unto him; and they are as far from the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:48335:52"/> mercy and favour of God, whoſe prayers are not regarded. And if a man be upon ſuch bad terms with God, that he is not regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when he is at his beſt work, his praying-wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>k, O how little is ſuch a one regarded when he is at his worſt work, his ſinning-work! If ſome men are not regarded, when they are praying to God, what are they when they are ſwearing, and blaſpheming God, when they are cauſleſly vexing or oppreſſing their brethren? If ſome men are not regarded when they are praying, what are they when they are revelling and reviling! The Lords indignation breaketh out to the utmoſt againſt wicked men, when he tells them, the beſt of their duties, their prayer, is vanity, and though they cry much to him, he will not hear nor regard them. <hi>The Lord hath not ſaid to the ſeed of Jacob, ſeek ye me in vaine,</hi> (Iſa. 45.19.) that is, ye ſhall not ſeek me in vaine, no, as your prayers are honourable and acceptable unto me, ſo they ſhall be profitable and beneficial unto you; you that go forth weeping, bearing, and ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering this precious ſeed, ſhall doubtleſs come again and bring your ſheaves with you, your prayers ſhall be returned with bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings upon your ſouls, upon your bodies, upon your eſtates, upon your families, in which you live, as alſo upon the Nations and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Churches among whom you live. Thus the ſeed of <hi>Jacob</hi> have found and ſhall further find by the bleſſed experiences of all theſe bleſſings, that God hath not ſaid to them, <hi>Seek ye me in vaine.</hi> He hath only ſaid of them who are vaine, your ſeekings of me are vaine in themſelves, and will be vaine, fruitleſs, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerleſs unto you; for <hi>I the Lord will not hear vanity, neither will I the Almighty regard it.</hi>

This tranſlation is much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon, and becauſe it hath a profitable ſenſe, I ſhall note two or three poynts from the latter part of the verſe, where it differs from ours, and then proceed to our own Tranſlation. <hi>Job</hi> being charged with ſin for ſaying, that <hi>he ſhould not ſee God,</hi> is here adviſed to judge himſelf, <hi>Judge thy ſelf, and look to, or truſt in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Note;
<q>It is our duty to judge our ſelves.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And 'tis a great Goſpel duty: The Apoſtle gives it in plain words, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.31.) <hi>If we would judge our ſelves, we ſhould not be judged of the Lord.</hi> We are very apt to judge one another, but very backward to judge our ſelves. It is a great work to erect a Tribunal (as I may ſay) in our own Souls and Conſciences, to ſit in Judgement upon our ſelves; which that we may do, we muſt do theſe three things. Firſt, we muſt ſend Summons to our ſelves, we muſt cite our ſelves to our own Tribunal; for alwayes before Judgement, Summons muſt go out and be ſent to the party of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending: Here we are to ſend Summons to our ſelves, that is, to call together all the powers of our ſouls to appear in this Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and anſwer what is or may be alledged againſt us. And when we have Summoned our ſelves, then ſecondly, we are to
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:48335:54"/> examine, ſearch, and try our ſelve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, (<hi>Lam.</hi> 3.41.) <hi>Let us ſearch and try our wayes, and turn again unto the Lord.</hi> Thirdly, having tryed and examined our ſelves, before we can come to Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (that Judgement which is here intended) we muſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our ſelves under a Conviction of our own vileneſs and ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, whether of our nature or of our actions, whether of our ſtate or of our way; for whereas there are two parts of Judgement, Abſolution and Condemnation, we can never come to that part of Judgement, the judging of our ſelves, as perſons worthy to be condemned by the Lord for our ſins, unleſs we are firſt convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of our ſins. Now when we have ſummoned, examined, and convicted our ſelves, then we are ready to judge our ſelves, to judge our ſelves even with the judgement of condemnation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting what we have done, yet we ſhould do it (with hopes of abſolution) acting our faith upon the free grace and mercy of God through the ſatisfaction which Jeſus Chriſt hath made for us.</p>
                  <p>Again, The ſcope of this counſel, or the reaſon why <hi>Elihu</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeth <hi>Job</hi> to judge himſelf, was to ſhew, that he had raſhly jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of the wayes of God, becauſe he had not duly judged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note;
<q>Self-judging, or judging our own doings, will preſerve us from raſh judging the doings and dealings of God with us.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>We ſhall never think God deals harſhly, or rigorouſly with us, if we do but enter into and paſs a right judgement upon our own ſouls. As they that judge themſelves ſhall not be judged of the Lord, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.31.) ſo, they that judge themſelves will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver judge the Lord; no, they will acquit and juſtifie the Lord under all his proceedings, even in his ſoreſt and ſevereſt ones. Thus did <hi>Ezra</hi> in reference to thoſe great and unparalel'd ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the <hi>Jewes</hi> in the Babylonian warr and captivity, (<hi>Chap.</hi> 9.13.) <hi>Thou our God haſt puniſhed us leſs than our iniquities deſerve.</hi> And ſo did <hi>Daniel</hi> (Chap. 9.7.) <hi>O Lord, righteouſneſs belongeth unto thee, but unto us confuſion of faces, as at this day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Further, <hi>Elihu</hi> concluded <hi>Job</hi> very much affected with, or high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conceited of himſelf, becauſe he pleaded his own innocency or integrity ſo much, and was ſo deſirous to come to a hearing, and have his matter tryed before God; and therefore ſaith he, <hi>Judge thy ſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:48335:54"/>
                  <p>Hence Note;
<q>Self-judging will keep us from proud or high thoughts of our ſelves, of our own wayes or works, how good ſoever they are.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Suppoſe our wayes and our works pure and good, as <hi>Jobs</hi> indeed were for the maine, (he was a man of the higheſt elevation in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and of greateſt integrity) yet if we would thoroughly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and judge our ſelves, conſider our ſhort comings in duty, our ſinnings againſt duty, and the ſins that cleave to our beſt du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, we ſhould find our very innocency to be guilty, and our righteouſneſs to be unrighteous; and ſurely ſuch a diſcovery would lay us very low in our own thoughts, and go very far towards the ſubduing of that pride of our hearts, which often ariſeth from the contemplation of our own wel-doing.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Conſider this counſel was given <hi>Job</hi> (according to this tranſlation) with reſpect to that which follows; <hi>Judge thy ſelf, and truſt in or wait for him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Note;
<q>We are never fit to truſt, nor to wait upon God in any of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences, till we judge our ſelves; <hi>or,</hi> Judging of our ſelves will diſpoſe and prepare our hearts for truſting and reſting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the power, goodneſs and mercy of God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The more we judge and humble our ſelves, the readier ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>h God declared himſelf to help us in our extremities, (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5 6.) we alſo are then the readier to truſt and wait on him, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we then ſee more clearly what need we have to truſt on him for help, and may have the more aſſurance of his help, while we truſt him.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall now proceed to our own tranſlation, which fairly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodates the ſcope of <hi>Elihu's</hi> dealing with <hi>Job</hi> in this place.</p>
                  <q>Although thou ſayest thou ſhalt not ſee him.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Elihu</hi> had reprehended two of <hi>Jobs</hi> ſayings before in this Chapter; here he reprehends a third; <hi>Although thou ſayeſt this, thou ſhalt not ſee him;</hi> although thou ſayeſt it, either ſecretly in thy heart, (the fool ſaith in his heart there is no God) or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though thou ſayeſt it with thy mouth, and haſt openly declared thy deſpayre of ſeeing him. Some paſſages in the diſcourſe of <hi>Job</hi>
                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:48335:55"/> do more than intimate and imply, that he had ſaid, <hi>he ſhould not ſee God.</hi> And we may conceive that <hi>Elihu</hi> aimeth at that paſſage ſpecially (<hi>Chap.</hi> 23.8, 9.) where <hi>Job</hi> ſeems to ſay this thing; <hi>Behold, I go forward, but he is not there, and backward, but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perceive him; on the left hard where he doth work, but I cannot behold him; he hideth himſelf on the right hand, that I cannot ſee him.</hi> Now, <hi>Elihu</hi> gives anſwer in this 14th verſe, ſhewing, that al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>There is a two-fold ſight of God; Firſt, immediate, or in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and thus God is ſeen only by himſelf, and of himſelf, to all others he is inviſible, <hi>No eye hath ſeen him, nor can ſee him,</hi> (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.16.) The Lord told <hi>Moſes, No man can ſee my face and live;</hi> that is, no man can ſee me immediately, no man can have any ocular ſight of me, as we ſee thoſe things that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us; <hi>God is a Spirit,</hi> and therefore inviſible. <hi>Job</hi> doth not complain, (in this ſenſe) that he could not ſee God, for he knew God was not to be ſeen, nor did he wait for any ſuch corporal view or ſight or preſence of God. Secondly, There is a mediate ſight of God, and that by a three-fold means; Firſt, in or by his Word; for that is one glaſs wherein we behold him. Secondly, there is a ſight of God in his Works, they are another glaſs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we ſee and behold him; and thoſe works are two fold; Firſt, the works of Creation, <hi>in them we may ſee</hi> or contemplate God all the world over, in his power, wiſdome, and goodneſs, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 1.19, 20.) Secondly, his works of providence, ordering and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing all the motions of the creatures, as himſelf pleaſeth, how much ſoever any of their motions are diſpleaſing unto him. Thus we may ſee God in his works, that is, it is ſeen by his works, not
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:48335:55"/> only that he is, but what he is, or that he is Eternal and Infinite, that he is Moſt Wiſe and Omnipotent, that he can do all things, or that nothing is too hard for him, he having brought all things out of nothing. There is a Third Medium or Means by which we may ſee God, and that is, <hi>His Son, our Lord Jeſus Christ,</hi> (2 Cor. 4.6.) <hi>The light of the knowledge of the Glory of God ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to us in the face of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> that is, in the perſon of Chriſt, God-Man, we may behold the glorious Grace of God unto poor ſinful loſt man. All the beams of Divine Love are collected in, and iſſue forth from the face of Jeſus Chriſt. He that would ſee how good, how gracious, how merciful the Lord is to ſinners, let him by an eye of Faith, or ſpiritual Contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on look Chriſt in the face, and there he ſhall find the expreſſe Characters of all that Glory. By theſe Means, or mediately in all theſe wayes, God may be ſeen, and is ſeen by his People. This threefold ſight of God, is the ſight of Faith; it is by Faith that we ſee him in his Word; it is by Faith that we ſee him in his Works; it is by Faith that we ſee him in his Son. Thus we are to underſtand that of the Apoſtle concerning <hi>Moſes,</hi> (Heb. 11.27.) <hi>He endured, as ſeeing him that is inviſible.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We may alſo diſtinguiſh of this ſight of God two ways; there is a ſight of God firſt in grace, which is, though a true and real, yet an imperfect ſight, of which the Apoſtle ſpeaks (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12.) <hi>Now we ſee as in a glaſſe, darkly.</hi> Secondly, There is a ſeeing of God in glory, which is there called <hi>A ſeeing of him face to face:</hi> Of that ſight Chriſt ſpeaks (<hi>Math.</hi> 5.8.) <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart, for they ſhall ſee God.</hi> As they now ſee him in the diſpenſations of his Grace here, ſo they ſhall ſee him in the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings forth, or manifeſtations of his Glory to them hereafter. Now when <hi>Job</hi> complaineth, or <hi>Elihu</hi> brings him in complaining, <hi>That he ſhould not ſee God,</hi> we are not to underſtand it, as if he deſpaired of ever ſeeing God in Glory, or had concluded in his own breaſt, that he ſhould never ſee him in his ways of Grace, or profeſſed that at preſent he had no ſight at all of God by faith; for, though I conceive <hi>Jobs</hi> ſight of God by faith, or in the actings of his Grace, at that time was very low and dim, yet ſome ſight he had of him by faith, enough I am ſure to preſerve and keep him from making any ſuch negative Concluſion againſt himſelf, that he ſhould not ſee God in Glory.

                     <hi>Job</hi> ſpake this as the worſt of his caſe, as that which was a greater grief and miſery to him, than all his other miſeries and griefs, that God would not ſet him in a clear light before others, or that himſelf ſhould not have a clear light from God concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his condition.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note;
<q>The ſight of God, or Gods diſcoverie of himſelf in any dark caſe, is very ſweet to an upright and gracious ſoul.</q>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> had begged for this once and again, though poſſibly, as <hi>Elihu</hi> would here convince him, he was ſomething too forward in it, and did not enough reflect upon himſelf; yet as he had oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en deſired it, ſo doubtleſſe it was exceeding much upon his heart, that he might have a clear diſcovery from God. The Apoſtle, in ſomewhat a like caſe, in being aſperſed in his Miniſtry, ſaith, <hi>We are made manifeſt unto God,</hi> (2 Cor. 5.11.) It pleaſed him that he was manifeſt unto God: But when God is pleaſed to manifeſt himſelf unto a Soul, how pleaſing is that?

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:48335:56"/> clearing up our ſtate, how ſatisfying is it! And as it is moſt ſweet and ſatisfying to ſee God clearing up our ſtate to our own conſciences, ſo it is exceeding ſweet to ſee him clearing up our actions to the eye of the world; as the Apoſtle ſpake in the ſame place, <hi>We are manifeſt unto God, and I truſt alſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

As God ſometimes ſheweth himſelf in a kind of cloud or darkneſs, in fire and tempeſt, which is very terrible to the ſoul; ſo he at other times diſcovers himſelf only a little, or gives but a glimpſe of himſelf clearly, to ſtir up further deſi es of ſeeing him, and to make us weary of all we ſee in this world: in theſe caſes we may be ſaid not to ſee God when we ſee him.

                  <p>Thirdly, Obſerve;
<q>Good men are apt ſometimes to make over-ſad concluſions againſt themſelves,</q>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:48335:57"/>
                  <p>As evil men are apt to make over-good concluſions for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they doubt not but they ſhall ſee and enjoy God. O what preſumptuous thoughts have men, and what peremptory, though groundleſs, concluſions do they make for themſelves upon falſe and rotten premiſes! they will ſay, they know God, and are known of God, they ſee God, and enjoy God, when they know not the meaning, much leſs have taſted the comfort of knowing God, or of being known by him, of ſeeing God, or of enjoying him. Theſe myſterious experiences are not every man's meat, nor every man's matters, who makes title to the knowledge of God. The Apoſtle ſaith expreſly, (1 <hi>John</hi> 2.4.) <hi>He that ſaith I know him, and keepeth not his Commandements, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.</hi> And again, (<hi>Chap.</hi> 3.6.) <hi>Whoſoever ſinneth</hi> (that is, loves and lives in ſin) <hi>hath not ſeen him, neither known him.</hi> Yet how many are there, far from keeping the Commandements of God, far from a holy life, yea far from a holy ſtate, ſo far from ſuch a holy life, as of which it may be ſaid in a Goſpel ſenſe, that they ſin not, that indeed they do nothing elſe but ſin! yet theſe are apt to conclude, they ſee God, they ſee him by faith, they know him, they doubt not but he is their God. Now as many carnal men are apt to make falſe concluſions to themſelves of an intereſt in God, when there is no ſuch matter, kindling a fire, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing themſelves about with their own ſparks, as the Prophet ſpeaks, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.11.) that is, with vaine conceits of their own blowing up, that all is well with them; when all that they, who do ſo, ſhall have at Gods hand, is, <hi>they ſhall lie down in ſorrow.</hi> So on the other ſide, godly men often times make ſad concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt themſelves, they ſay (as <hi>Job</hi> in the Text) <hi>they ſhall not ſee him;</hi> who though (as was ſhewed in opening the Text) he did not conclude againſt his ſight of God by grace, or that he had no ſight of him by faith, yet he had not a comfortable ſight as to his preſent enjoyment, and he doubted whether ever he ſhould in this world. <hi>Jonah</hi> made ſuch a concluſion (<hi>Chap.</hi> 2.4.) <hi>Then I ſaid, I am caſt out of thy ſight.</hi> As <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſaid in his ſickneſs, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.11.) <hi>I ſhall not ſee the Lord, even the Lord in the Land of the living;</hi> that is, I ſhall die, and ſhall no more go into the houſe of the Lord, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to enquire in his Temple, which was the one thing, even the only thing (in this life) which <hi>David</hi> deſired and reſolved to ſeek after,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:48335:57"/> (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.4.) So many, while they live, are apt to make ſuch concluſions, they ſhall ſee God no more, they ſhall not ſee him as long as they live, they are afraid they ſhall never have comfort more, nor peace more, while they are in this world, while they are on this ſide heaven; yet whether ever they ſhall come to ſee him in heaven, is their greateſt, their ſaddeſt, their moſt heart-diſquieting and heart-breaking doubt and feare. And indeed as we cannot ſee God, untill he gives us eyes, ſo we cannot believe we ſhall ſee him, untill he gives us hearts. Many times his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, both as to outward terrible providences, and inward terrors, are ſo dark, that we can ſee nothing but darkneſs, nor ſay any thing but as <hi>Job</hi> is here charged to ſay, that <hi>we ſhall not ſee him.</hi> Yea, God doth often hide himſelf from his people on purpoſe to try whether they will truſt him and wait upon him under ſuch with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawings, for ſalvation, whether temporal or eternal, (<hi>Iſal.</hi> 45.15.) <hi>Thou art a God that hidest thy ſelf, O God of Iſrael, the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our:</hi> Let us therefore take heed of ſaying, he will be for ever hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, or that we ſhall never ſee, nor behold him as a Saviour; ſay not it is ſo dark with us, that as now we ſee no light, ſo our night ſhall never have a morning.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, From theſe words, <hi>Although thou ſayeſt thou ſhalt not ſee him,</hi> Note,
<q>A good man is apt to give his heart and tongue too much liberty.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>We ſhould watch our hearts, to keep out or caſt out vaine thoughts, we ſhould ſtrangle diſtruſtful and unbelieving thoughts in the very birth, that ſo our tongues may never bring them forth, nor publiſh them to the offence of others. <hi>Thou haſt ſaid, thou ſhalt not ſee him.</hi> But when our unbridled tongues have run at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and ſpoken what is not right, yet God will do what is right, as the next words aſſure us.</p>
                  <q>Yet Judgment is before him.</q>
                  <p>Theſe words plainly intimate, that <hi>Jobs</hi> ſcope, when he ſaid he ſhould not <hi>ſee God,</hi> was, that he ſhould not ſee him as a Judge clearing up his cauſe, or appearing to vindicate the wrong done him, and to do him right. As if <hi>Elihu</hi> had ſaid, Whatever thy opinion is concerning God, that he will never appear in thy cauſe to do thee right, yet know this (O <hi>Job) Judgement is before him,</hi>
                     <pb n="108" facs="tcp:48335:58"/> and therefore I adviſe thee, be thou better perſwaded both of his preſence with thee, and of his providence over thee. The word rendred <hi>Judgement,</hi> is that from which one of the Patriarks had his name, and it is a great elegancy, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 49.16.) <hi>Dan ſhall Judge his people.</hi> The proper name <hi>Dan,</hi> is the ſame with the Verb which follows, <hi>ſhall Judge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When <hi>Judgement is ſaid to be before the Lord,</hi> it may be taken three wayes, (ſo we find it in the Sc ipture) Firſt, we read there of Judgement as it is oppoſed to mercy. Theſe terrible and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Judgements of God are every where ſpoken of. Secondly, Judgement is oppoſed to imprudence and want of underſtanding or diſcretion; Judgement is a wiſe and clear ſight or apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of things; as we ſay ſuch a one is a Judicious man, or a man of a great Judgement. Thirdly, Judgement is oppoſed to injuſtice or to un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ighteouſneſs; thus we do judgement and juſtice. Many have a great ſtock of judgement or underſtanding, who yet will do little judgment, that is, little juſtice, they have a right underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of things, yet will do little or nothing right. Here, when it is ſaid, <hi>Judgment is before him,</hi> we are to underſtand it in the two lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſenſes; for though it be a great truth that judgment as oppoſed to mercy, is before the Lord, <hi>And he ſhall have judgement with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mercy, that hath ſhewed no mercy,</hi> though (as the Apoſtle adds in the ſame place <hi>James</hi> 2.13.) <hi>Mercy rejoyceth</hi> (or <hi>glorieth) againſt Judgement;</hi> The Lord hath judgements, all manner of judgements about him, yet that notion of judgement doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to this place, but the two latter. <hi>Judgement is before him;</hi> that is, he is a God of infinite underſtanding and wiſdome, he ſeeth every thing to the utmoſt, he goes to the bottome of every mans caſe, yea, to the very bottome of every mans heart; he ſees every action quite through, and every perſon: And as he knows the truth of every mans cauſe and caſe, ſo he will do every man right, according to the merit of his cauſe and caſe. <hi>Juſtice and Judgement are the habitation of his throne, while clouds and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs are round about him,</hi> (Pſal. 97.2.) that is, though preſent diſpenſations are obſcure (as in <hi>Jobs</hi> caſe) yet both the proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure and dealings of God, as alſo the iſſue or determination which he gives in every matter, is juſt and righteous to all men, as well as gracious and comfortable to good and upright-hearted men. Thus, Judgement, or this judgement is alwayes <hi>before him,</hi>
                     <pb n="109" facs="tcp:48335:58"/> that is, he hath a clear ſight of it, and he is ready to do it.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note, Firſt,
<q>God hath a right and clear apprehenſion of all perſons and actions;</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>His underſtanding is infinite. <hi>The Lord is</hi> (as <hi>Hannah</hi> ſpake in her Thankſgiving-Song, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.3.) <hi>a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed;</hi> That is, he knoweth them exactly, to a grain, as we do the weight of thoſe things which we have laid in an even Balance. It is required of Judges (in that advice which <hi>Jethro</hi> gave to <hi>Moſes,</hi> Exod. 18.21.) That they ſhould be <hi>able men,</hi> that is, (not ſo much men of able purſes, as) of able parts, men of able judgement, and of more than common under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, even ſuch as were able to look through every mans Cauſe that came before them. Such is the ability of the Lords underſtanding to the full, he is Omniſcient, <hi>He is light, and in him is no darkneſſe at all.</hi> And as in him there is no darkneſſe, ſo nothing is dark to him; the moſt intricate and knotty Caſe, the moſt ravel'd and vext Cauſe that ever was, is plain and evident before his eyes, with whom we have to do, and who hath to do with us. <hi>Judgement is before him;</hi> neither is there any Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before any other in compariſon of him; God hath ſo much light, that Men and Angels are to him but darkneſſe; God ſeeth ſo much, that all others may be ſaid not to ſee, or to be ſtark blind; even thoſe Judges may be called blind, who are not blinded, we may ſay they have no eyes, whoſe eyes are not put out with gifts, compared with God. How blind then are thoſe Judges, who are blinded? and whoſe eyes are put out, either by prejudice or paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, by hopes or fears! it cannot be, but Judgement muſt be before God, becauſe as he cleerly ſees, and fully underſtands whatſoever comes before him, ſo nothing can divert or biaſs him f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>om doing every man right, according to his ſight and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. <hi>Judgement is before him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Note, Secondly,
<q>God will do right to every man, as ſure as he knows the right of every man.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are many who know what is right, who know whoſe Cauſe is right, yet will not do right. But as ſure as God knows every mans righ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <p>We muſt wait upon God, and truſt in him, though we do not ſee him, yea, though we cannot ſee him, <hi>for Judgement is before him.</hi> That of the Prophet (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.10.) is a clear proof of this duty, (and ſome expound this Scripture ſpecially reſpecting out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward dark providences, as others of inward darkneſs, or darkneſs of ſpirit) <hi>Who is among you that feareth the Lord, and obeyeth the voyce of his ſervants, that walketh in darkneſs, and hath no light</hi> (as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith here, <hi>I ſhall not ſee him</hi>) What ſhall a poor benighted ſoul do in that caſe?

The Lord can command light out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, good out of evil, order out of confuſion, and he can do all this eaſily, and at an inſtant; therefore whatever the appearances of things are, let not us judge according to appearance, but hope
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:48335:60"/> and wait, and ſtick to what God hath promiſed. Though provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences appear croſs to promiſes and propheſies, yet they never fruſtrate either. Let us alſo be ſure to ſtick to the commandements of God, for we may reſt aſſured, God will ſtick to his promiſes. To keep Commandements is our work, to keep promiſes is Gods work; though we fayle much in our work, God will not fayle at all in his work: To believe this, is the higheſt and trueſt work of faith. But if we are faithful in our work, the keeping of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, we have a further evidence, that God will be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in his work, the keeping or fulfilling of promiſes, (a great part, the moſt ſpiritual part of Gods fulfilling promiſes, being his ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of us to keep Commandements) and then we ſhall be able to ſay, not only in faith, but from experience, <hi>that Judgement is before him.</hi> And untill we come to this concluſion of faith in dark times, when we cannot ſee him, the ſoul never ſits down in reſt. Nothing fixes the ſoul but truſt in God; we are unquiet, yea we boyle with unquietneſs, and toſs as the angry Sea with the windes, till we truſt fully upon God, upon his wiſdome and power, upon his goodneſs and faithfulneſs, and can ſay, let him do as ſeems good in his eyes; we know he is and will be <hi>good to Iſrael, even to ſuch as are of a clean heart.</hi> When we can once ſtay our minds on God, we are quiet; but when we muſt bring God to our mind, and muſt have God go our pace, or come at our time, and work in our way, (none of which he will do, what a do ſoever we make to have it ſo) O how reſtleſs and troubled are we, even like the troubled Sea when it cannot reſt! And O how much of this reſtleſs trouble diſcovers it ſelf in the minds of many (that I ſay not the moſt of) men, and all becauſe they cannot truſt God when they do not ſee him, or becauſe when they do not ſee him (which was <hi>Jobs</hi> fayling) they ſay, <hi>they ſhall not ſee him.</hi> If matters come not to paſs according to their platforme, and model, or hit not the dates and dayes, the times and ſeaſons which they have fixt in their unſcriptural Kalender, or by a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake of the Scripture Kalendar, they are ready to ſay, <hi>they ſhall not ſee him,</hi> their hopes are as the giving up of the ghoſt, that is, they give all for loſt, and paſt recovery. <hi>Many truſt God</hi> (as they do ſome men) <hi>no farther than they ſee him;</hi> they are the worſt and courſeſt ſort of men, whom we truſt no otherwiſe. How di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhonourable then, how infinitely below God is ſuch a truſt?

                     <hi>Elihu</hi> would have <hi>Job</hi> (and ſo ſhould we) truſt God, though he could not ſee him, and ſaid he ſhould not. <hi>Thou haſt ſaid, thou ſhalt not ſee him, yet truſt in him.</hi>

                  <p>Note hence;
<q>The conſideration of the Righteouſneſs and Juſtice of God, is a mighty argument to provoke us to truſt him, and wait upon him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Truſt is not every bodyes due; ſome (as we ſpeak proverbial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) are to be truſted no farther than a man can throw a Milſtone, that is, they are not to be truſted at all: Truſt (I ſay) is not every bodyes due: but to truſt God is every bodyes duty, yea and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt too, for he is cloathed as much with righteouſneſs and juſtice, as he is with ſtrength and power. Will you not truſt an honeſt man, will you not truſt a wiſe man? We can come to a height of confidence in man ſometimes, if we think him a man of judgement and wiſdome, of honeſty and faithfulneſs, we can truſt all we have in ſuch a mans hand; how much more ſhould we ſay to God, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Judgement is before him, therefore will we truſt in him!</hi> We have an eminent Scripture, urging this duty upon this ground, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.18.) <hi>The Lord is a God of Judgement</hi> (Judgement is there taken in the ſame notion as here in the Text, he is a wiſe and a juſt God, the Lord is a God of judgement, what followeth) <hi>Bleſſed are they that wait for him.</hi> There can be nothing ſaid, more urging, more encouraging to wait and truſt on God, to do us right, then this, <hi>He is a God of Judgement, a righteous God, Judgement is before him.</hi>

                  <p>Thus far of the good counſel which <hi>Elihu</hi> gave <hi>Job</hi> in this his dark and deſerted ſtate; and counſel it was worthy to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced with both armes, and with an open breaſt; and that <hi>Job</hi> had need of it, he ſhews in the next words, while he tells <hi>Job</hi> and us, it was not ſo with him yet, as appeared by the ſad hand of God upon him, and his own diſtemper under it.</p>

                  <p>To <hi>viſit,</hi> is properly to go to, and ſee any perſon whom we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and love; thus we viſit friends in civility and courteſie. Secondly, To <hi>viſit</hi> is an act of pity and mercy; and thus we <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit</hi> the ſick, the widdow, and the fatherleſſe (<hi>James</hi> 1.27.) <hi>Pure Religion, and undefiled before God, and the Father, is to viſit the fatherleſſe and widows in their affliction;</hi> that is, to go to them in pity, either for the ſupply of their wants by our purſe, or for the comforting of their hearts by our counſel. Thirdly, We <hi>viſit</hi> in care, as well as in kindneſſe, that is, when we go to our Families or Flocks, or places of charge, whereſoever they are, and ſee that, or whether, all things are well and right with them, or well, and rightly done towards them, according to the rules that ſuch perſons under our charge ought to act, and live by: Thus in Colledges and Hoſpitals, there is a viſitation of care, to make enquiry of perſons in truſt, about perſons and things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their truſt.</p>
                  <p>To the Point in hand; there is a twofold viſitation of God.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, He viſits in love and mercy, (<hi>Ruth.</hi> 1.6.) <hi>Then ſhe</hi> (that is <hi>Naomi) aroſe with her Daughter in Law, that ſhe might return from the Countrey of Moab, for ſhe had heard in the Countrey of Moab, how that the Lord had viſited his people in giving them bread.</hi> That is, God had ſhewed them kindneſſe and mercy in relieving them from that devouring famine. Again, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 21.6.) <hi>And the Lord viſited Sarah, as he had ſaid;</hi> that is, he gave her the promiſed mercy of a Son. Once more, (<hi>Luke</hi> 1.68.) <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſrael, for he hath viſited, and redeemed his People;</hi> and that's a bleſſed viſitation indeed, which brings redemption. Thus the Scripture often ſpeaks of Gods viſitation in mercy.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is a viſitation of God in anger, wrath and judgement. The Law ſaith (<hi>Exod.</hi> 20.4, 5.) <hi>Thou ſhalt not make to thy ſelf any graven Image,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thou ſhalt not bow down thy ſelf to them, nor ſerve them; for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, viſiting the iniquity of the Fathers upon the Children, unto the third and fourth Generation of them that hate me:</hi> That is puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the iniquity of the Fathers upon the Children, theſe Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren continuing in their Fathers ways, to do ſinfully; ſuch Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

Becauſe it is not ſo, he hath viſited in his anger.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Note, Firſt,
<q>God expects the work of Faith and Patience, when his afflicting hand is upon us.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Faith hath much work to do at all times, but moſt in times of affliction. There is alſo a uſe of two ſorts of patience in our beſt dayes; the patience of labouring in Gods work, and the patience of waiting for the reward of our work, after all our labours: But in ſad dayes the Lord expects we ſhould exerciſe both patience in ſuffering, and in waiting for deliverance out of all our ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; then 'tis that both Faith and Patience, truſting and waiting muſt have their perfect work.</p>
                  <p>Secondly Note;
<q>When the Lord doth not find or ſee, as he expects, the work of Faith and Patience in a time of affliction, he will afflict more and more until he finds or works it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is it which <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith in the Text, <hi>Becauſe it is not ſo, he hath viſited in his anger. Job</hi> was ſorely afflicted before, but now he is viſited in anger, becauſe he did not manifeſt ſuch truſt in God as he expected in that condition. As when the wicked re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:48335:65"/> not of their ſins under the puniſhing hand of God, he will puniſh them more and more, even ſeven times more for their ſins, (<hi>Levit.</hi> 26.41.) So when good men act not their Graces, believe not, truſt not under the afflicting hand of God, he uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly afflicts them more and more, gives them ſoarer ſtripes, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth yet heavier burdens on them. When God miſſeth what he lock'd for, we may quickly feel what we looked not for. Mr. <hi>Braughtons</hi> Tranſlation ſpeaks the Point fully, <hi>But now for miſſing, his anger doth viſit.</hi> Man ſeldome miſſeth t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ouble from God, when God miſſeth duty from man; and 'tis a me cy that he doth not: 'tis mans mercy when God minds him of his deficiencies in duty, though by a ſmart viſiting rod. Thus the Lord ſpake of <hi>Davids</hi> Seed, (and 'tis to be underſtood of all the Seed of Chriſt, whom <hi>David</hi> typed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.) <hi>If his children forſake my Law,</hi> (v. 30, 31.) <hi>Then</hi> (verſ. 32.) <hi>will I viſit their tranſgreſſions with the Rod,</hi> &amp;c. How true this charge of <hi>Elihu</hi> was, as to <hi>Jobs</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of duty, I ſhall not ſtay to enquire; only this we know, <hi>Job</hi> had profeſſed truſt in God, yet becauſe it was mingled with ſo much complaint, with ſo many unbelieving expoſtulations, <hi>Elihu</hi> might ſay the Lord miſſed the patience, truſt and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which he expected from <hi>Job.</hi> Doubtleſſe, more of all theſe ſhould have appeared in him, and they ſhould have appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more in that time of affliction. There are two things which God looketh for, and aims at in the time of our affliction; firſt, the mortifying of corruptions, that they wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     </gap>king, and work more ſtrongly than ever they have done. Where the Lord ſees not theſe effects of affliction, that our ſins grow leſſe, and our graces more, that we complain leſſe, and truſt or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve more, we are like to be afflicted more, and he will diſcover his anger more. <hi>Becauſe it is not ſo, he hath viſited in his anger.</hi> And thence</p>
                  <p>Note, Thirdly;
<q>Diſtruſt or impatience under the affl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>cting hand of God, or our not truſting God in our worſt condition patiently, is a very provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſin.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>We provoke the Lord to viſit us in his anger, when we do not
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:48335:66"/> truſt in his mercy. Our not truſting God muſt needs provoke him to anger; for when we do not truſt him, we queſtion him; diſtruſt or unbelief queſtions all that God is, and all that God hath promiſed, it queſtions his Truth, and his Faithfulneſſe, his Power, his Mercy, and his Goodneſſe; all theſe, which are the glory of God, and in all which the ſons of men ought to glorifie him, theſe are all queſtioned and darkned, when we put not forth acts of truſt and reliance upon God, in times of greateſt affliction and extremity. Is it not then a provoking ſin, I ſay not to with-draw truſt from God, and give it to an arm of fleſh, but not to put out freſh and full acts of truſt upon God, let our affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or extremity be what it will! The Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were in great extremity at the Red Sea, a mighty Army purſuing them at the heels to deſtroy them, and mighty waters being before them, ready to ſwallow them up; in theſe ſtraits (whileſt they ſhould have done their utmoſt to get, and aſſure God to be their Friend) the Pſalmiſt tells us, <hi>They provoked him,</hi> (Pſal. 106, 7.) But wherein lay their provocation? that Scripture ſaith, <hi>They remembred not the multitude of his mercies:</hi> The former mercies of the Lord did not ſtrengthen their truſt in preſent troubles; that was one provocation. And as former mercies did not ſtrengthen their truſt, ſo the preſent trouble drew out their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt, as another Scripture aſſures, reporting their behaviour in it (<hi>Exod.</hi> 14.11.) <hi>And they ſaid to Moſes, Becauſe there were no Graves in Egypt, haſt thou taken us away to dye in the Wilderneſſe? Wherefore haſt thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?</hi> What were theſe fearful fore-caſts, theſe amazing bode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of an unavoidable (as they apprehended) ruine, but the overflowings of unbelief, or diſtruſt in God; and this was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther provocation. Former mercies are forgotten, yea eaten up by unbelief, as the ſeaven lean Kine in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> dream, eat up the fat ones, and preſent difficulties are aggravated by unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, as if all the power of God could not remove and overcome them. And will not the Lord (think you) viſit in anger for ſuch a ſin as this?</p>
                  <p>Again, As <hi>Elihu</hi> doth not ſay barely, he hath viſited, but <hi>he hath viſited in his anger,</hi> or <hi>his anger hath viſited,</hi> ſo conſider, who was it that was thus viſited in anger? It was <hi>Job,</hi> a Godly man, a man perfect and upright.</p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:48335:66"/>
                  <p>Hence note, Fourthly;
<q>God viſits or afflicts, even his own people, his elect, and choiceſt ſervants, with fatherly anger, when they diſpleaſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>We find the Scripture ſpeaking expreſly of the anger of God towards the beſt of his ſervants, even towards a <hi>Moſes,</hi> (as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf made confeſſion, <hi>Deuter.</hi> 1.37.) when they diſpleaſe him; <hi>Alſo the Lord was angry with me for your ſakes, ſaying, thou alſo ſhalt not go in thither. Moſes</hi> was a moſt meek man, the meekeſt man upon the face of the earth, nor was he an inferior in any other grace, yet the Lord was angry wi h him, and angry with him upon that ſpecial occaſion, his unbeliefe, (<hi>Numb.</hi> 20.12.) <hi>And the Lord ſpake unto Moſes and Aaron, becauſe ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me not, to ſanctifie me in the eyes of the children of Iſrael, therefore</hi> &amp;c. We read of the Lords anger breaking out againſt <hi>Aaron</hi> for another ſin, (<hi>Numb.</hi> 12.9.) <hi>The anger of the Lord was kindled againſt them,</hi> that is, againſt <hi>Aaron and Miriam, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had ſpoken againſt Moſes,</hi> (verſ. 1.8.) <hi>Aaron</hi> was the High Prieſt, and as he was high in office, ſo eminent in grace; and doubtleſs <hi>Miriam</hi> was a very gracious woman, yet the Lord was not only angry with them, but exceeding angry; his anger waxed hot againſt them and kindled, when they forgot their duty to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and remembred not their diſtance with reverence. <hi>Solomon</hi> in his prayer at the Dedication of the Temple, ſpeaks of the people of God collectively; <hi>If they ſin againſt thee, and thou be angry with them.</hi> The Lord is not only angry with the world, but angry with his Church, not only angry with <hi>Babylon,</hi> but with <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpake that of the whole Nation of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> ſuppoſing they might fall under the Lords anger all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as a body; ſo he did experience it ſadly in his own perſon, (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 9.11.) <hi>And the Lord was angry with Solomon, becauſe his heart was turned from the Lord God of Iſrael, which had appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto him tw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 12.1.) <hi>And in that day thou ſhalt ſay, O Lord, I will praiſe thee: though thou waſt angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou comforteſt me.</hi> When we turn from God, his anger is turned againſt us, and when we turn to God, his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is turned away from us. When the Lord is angry, what can comfort us, but the turning away of his anger? And by the very act of turning away his anger, he comforts us, though all the world be angry with us.</p>
                  <p>But ſome may ſay, How doth the Lord, who is ſaid to love his people with an everlaſting love, viſit them in anger? To clear that, we may diſtinguiſh of anger.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, There is correcting anger: Secondly, there is conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming or deſtroying anger. Deſtroying anger is inconſiſtent with eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>laſting love, but not correcting anger: correcting anger may be very grievous, therefore the Prophet deprecates it, (<hi>Jer.</hi> 10.24.) <hi>Correct me, O Lord, in Judgement, not in thy anger.</hi> The Lord doth often exerciſe (that is as often as there is cauſe, and we give him cauſe too often to exerciſe) a ſmart and ſevere an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger towards his own people; but his conſuming and deſtroying anger is the lot and portion of the wicked; <hi>If his anger be kindled but a little</hi> (namely againſt his enemies) <hi>bleſſed are they that truſt in him;</hi> bleſſed are they that believe, when that anger of the Lord breaks forth againſt unbelievers. Or we may ſtate it thus;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, God is angry with ſinful perſons; thus he is angry with the world, or with wicked men.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God is angry with perſons for ſinning, (there is a great difference between theſe two; anger with ſinful perſons, and anger with perſons for their ſin, or for ſinning) and thus he is angry with his own people, even with the godly when they ſin, though not for every ſin.</p>
                  <p>Further, We may diſtinguiſh of anger thus; There is anger mixed with a deſire of taking revenge upon thoſe that we are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y with, a revengeful anger: thus the Lord is angry only with the wicked. Of this anger <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks, having deſcribed a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous ſinner, who believes not only without a word, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the word, who <hi>when he heareth the word of the curſe, bleſſeth
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:48335:67"/> himſelf in his heart, ſaying, I ſhall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of mine heart, to add drunkenneſs unto thirſt; then the anger of the Lord and his jealouſie ſhall ſmoak againſt that man,</hi> &amp;c. (<hi>Deut.</hi> 29.19, 20.) Read more of this revengeful anger of the Lord, (<hi>Deut.</hi> 32.22, 41, 42.) Secondly, there is anger with a deſire to reforme, and reclaime thoſe that we are angry with: Thus a loving and indulgent father is angry with his child, when he hath committed a fault; he is angry, not with an anger of deſire to revenge, but with an anger of deſire to reforme. And thus the Lord is angry with his own people, with his choiceſt ſervants, and deareſt children, when they forget their duty and play the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, We may diſtinguiſh of anger thus; There is Firſt, a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary anger: As there is a temporary faith in hypocrites, ſo (we may ſay) there is a temporary anger in God againſt the faithful when offending; that is, he is angry with them for a while, for a ſeaſon: <hi>Sing unto the Lord, O ye Saints of his, and give thanks at the remembrance of his Holineſs,</hi> (ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 30.4.) But why doth he call them to ſinging? we have the reaſon of it given at the 5th verſe, <hi>For his anger endureth but a moment;</hi> he ſpeaks there of the Lords anger againſt his Saints and peculiar people: while they indeed have cauſe to mourn for provoking the Lord to anger, they may alſo ſing, both becauſe his anger endureth but for a moment, that is, becauſe (if that be all) it endureth not at all, (a moment is of no endurance) as alſo becauſe <hi>in his favour is life; weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.</hi> Once more, hear the Prophets report of the Lords anger, (<hi>Micah</hi> 7.18.) <hi>Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and paſſeth by the tranſgreſſion of the remnant of his heritage; he retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not his anger for ever, becauſe he delighteth in mercy.</hi> God do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h not <hi>retain his anger for ever;</hi> that is, not long; yea, that <hi>not for ever,</hi> is but a little while, a moment, and that but a ſmall <hi>moment,</hi> as the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpake, (<hi>Chap.</hi> 54.7.) As if he had ſaid, The Lords anger is not retained ſo long, as if it ſhould be alwayes retained; his anger towards you is ſoon blown over, and gone, upon the matter (like a moment) as ſoon as come. Such is the anger which God diſcovers towards his own people.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is an anger for ever, an abiding wrath, a fire of anger which never goeth out, nor can be put out, which is kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:48335:68"/> in the breaſt of God againſt ungodly men, and againſt them only as living and dying without repentance, in their ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. <hi>Job</hi> a godly man, was viſited in the former, not in this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter anger.</p>
                  <p>Yet for the fuller anſwer to this query, as it concerns <hi>Jobs</hi> caſe, I conceive <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeaks with the higheſt and hardeſt towards him. For though it be a truth, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t the Lord diſcovers, as was ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, a fatherly anger towards his children when he chaſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them for their ſin, yet he chaſteneth them more, or rather, in love than in anger; <hi>As whom he loves, he rebukes and chaſtens, (Rev.</hi> 3.19.) ſo he chaſtens and rebukes them in love. And as for <hi>Job,</hi> whom God dearly loved, it is cleare from the firſt and ſecond Chapters of this Book, that God afflicted him not for any ſpecial ſin, or way of ſinning, but for his tryal, and to ſet him up as a great pattern of patience to all ſucceeding generations. Or we may ſay that God afflicted <hi>Job,</hi> not becauſe of any provocation which he had given him, but at Satans inſtance and provocation, (<hi>Chap.</hi> 2.3.) All that can be ſaid for <hi>Elihu's</hi> help in ſaying that God viſited him in anger, is only this, That though <hi>Job</hi> had not provoked the Lord to viſit him in anger when he began to viſit him, yet ſome impatient and over-bold ſpeeches of his, or that liberty of ſpeech which he took in expoſtulating and almoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting with God about his afflictions, might cauſe him to viſit him in ſuch anger as hath been ſet forth in anſwer to the query. <hi>And now becauſe it is not ſo,</hi> becauſe the Lord miſſeth thoſe acts of grace, truſt and patience, which thy caſe calleth thee to the exerciſe of, <hi>He hath viſited in his anger;</hi> and what followeth?</p>
                  <q>Yet he knoweth it not in great extremity.</q>

                     <hi>Elihu</hi> ſeems to have ſpoken this turning himſelf to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and complaining to them of <hi>Jobs</hi> inſenſibleneſs, <hi>Yet he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Some refer this clauſe of the verſe to God alſo, <hi>He hath viſited in his anger, and taketh no notice of the great increaſe, or of that which is greatly increaſed;</hi> that is, God hath ſpared nothing from his viſitation, although the party viſited were never ſo much grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved or damnified in the loſs and ſpoyle of his all. There was a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity (ſaith this Author) that he who was viſited ſhould be ſo toucht as to be ſenſible of the ſtroake; which could not be, unleſs
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:48335:68"/> the greateſt of his encreaſe, and thoſe things which were moſt dear to him were taken away from him, or he were ſtript naked and bereaved of them.</p>
                  <p>Our tranſlation refers theſe words to the perſon viſited, as if he, though reduced to the greateſt extremities, yet was not ſenſible of it, or took no notice of what he ſuffered, or was done to him; <hi>Yet he knoweth it not in great extremity.</hi> Who knoweth not? the Antecedent to <hi>he</hi> is <hi>Job,</hi> according to this tranſlation; <hi>becauſe he knoweth not.</hi> But what did not <hi>Job</hi> know? Firſt, He knew not the dealings of God with him, to ſubmit to them as he ſhould. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, He knew not that there was ſuch a miſs or deficiency in the acting of his graces, he perceived not how weak a ſoul he had in that weak body; his truſt, his faith, did not act, <hi>and yet he knew it not,</hi> or took no notice of his fayling in thoſe duties. Thirdly, <hi>He hath viſited in his anger, yet he knoweth it not,</hi> that is, he knoweth not the anger of God, who viſiteth him. To know may be taken three wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, For the bare notion or apprehenſion of a thing; thus certainly <hi>Job</hi> did know that he was viſited, for he ſpake often and enough of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To know, is to conſider, to lay a thing to heart, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.3.) <hi>My people doth not know, Iſrael doth not conſider,</hi> the latter part is exegetical, and expounds the former, <hi>My people doth not know,</hi> that is, <hi>doth not conſider.</hi> So (<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.8.) <hi>She did not know that I gave her corn,</hi> &amp;c. (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.11.) <hi>Who knoweth the power of thy anger?</hi> that is, who conſiders it? who weighes what the anger of the Lord is? we have ſweet thoughts, about the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and love, and goodneſs of God, yet 'tis little, very little of any of theſe that we know. The love of God, which we delight to know, paſſeth knowledge, (<hi>Eph.</hi> 3.19.) But for the anger of God, which is ſo dreadful, we ſeldome ſet our ſelves to the ſtudy of it; none can know it comprehenſively, and few ſeek or labour to know it induſtriouſly, conſiderately.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, To know, is to be under a due ſenſe of what we know: We may know a thing, and conſider it, yet not have a feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it. I conceive we are to underſtand the word <hi>know</hi> here, in theſe two latter ſenſes; <hi>He knoweth it not;</hi> that is, he doth not conſider, nor hath he a due ſenſe, either of the defect of his own graces, that his faith acts not as it ought, that his truſt performes
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:48335:69"/> not its part as it ſhould; nor doth he know the anger of God in this viſitation; that is, he knoweth not, nor conſidereth, the ſcope and meaning of God in this angry diſpenſation. <hi>Yet he knoweth it not</hi>
                     <q>In great extremity.</q>

Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> renders, <hi>Becauſe Job knoweth not this great plenty,</hi> namely, of ſorrows, which compaſs him about.</p>
                  <p>This was the cenſure of <hi>Elihu</hi> upon <hi>Job,</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> had given <hi>Elihu</hi> too much ground for this cenſure. Though <hi>Jobs</hi> Faith and truſt were ſtrongly at work ſomtimes, yet they did not alwayes continue their work in the ſame degree or ſtrength: and while he often complained in his extremity, that God dealt with him as with an enemy, he did not well conſider what that anger of God was, in which he viſited him, during the time of that great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity: <hi>Y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </p>
                  <p>As <hi>this not knowing</hi> is referred to his weakneſs in acting his Graces; <hi>now, it is not ſo,</hi> yet he knoweth it not;</p>
                  <p>Note;
<q>A godly man is not alwayes ſenſible of his defects and failings in grace.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As ſome have little or no Grace, who yet conceit they have much (<hi>Rev.</hi> 3.17.) <hi>Thou ſayeſt, I am rich, and encreaſed in goods, and have need of nothing, and knoweſt not that thou art wretched and miſerable, and poor, and naked.</hi> So others who have grace, yea, much grace in the habit (as <hi>Job</hi> had) may be very inſenſible how little it acts, yea they may ſuppoſe it acts much, when the actings of it are intermitted or extreamly ſuppreſſed by paſſion
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:48335:69"/> and corruption: They may think their Faith ſtrong, or that they truſt fully in God, they may think themſelves patient and humble under the hand of God, and yet be greatly defective in the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all theſe Graces; I mean not ſuch a deficiency only, as is common to all believers (the beſt come ſhort in the exerciſe of grace) but ſome great deficiency may be, and yet the ſoul not ſenſible of it. As ſome are over-ſenſible of their failings, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining that they have no Faith, no Patience, when they not only have Faith and Patience, as to their Being, but as to their working alſo, and poſſibly, working well. (It is a different work of the Spirit, to act and ſtir up Grace in us, and to diſcover to us the actings and ſtirrings of Grace) Now as ſome godly men act Grace, and know it not, ſo in others that are godly Grace acts not, and they know it not; Faith is down, and they know it not; they can bear little or nothing patiently, yet they take no notice of it. Thus the words of <hi>Elihu</hi> concerning <hi>Job, he knoweth it not,</hi> referr to the former part of the verſe, <hi>It is not ſo;</hi> that is, his Graces act not, yet he takes no notice of it, but thinks Faith and Patience, with other Graces, work well enough.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As <hi>not knowing</hi> refers to the viſitation of God, <hi>He hath viſited him in his anger, and he knoweth it not</hi> (yea, though) <hi>in great extremity,</hi> though he have a very hard time of it.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note, Firſt,
<q>A good man may not only be viſited, but extreamly viſited by the hand of God;</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He may be under many extremities at once; extreamly viſited in Body, extreamly in Mind, extreamly in his Relations, extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his Name, ext<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>amly in all his worldly concernments. As there is no outward evil, for the matter, ſo none for the degree, but a good man may be in it. Let us be moderate in judging thoſe, who are in the extreameſt extreamities of ſuffering.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Note;
<q>Some good men, or good men ſomtimes under very great afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are not ſenſible of the hand of the Lord upon them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As a good man may receive many mercies, and yet not obſerve (at preſent) how, or from whom he receives them, ſo he may be under angry viſitations or diſpenſations in great extremity, and
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:48335:70"/> not mind the dealing of God with him in it, nor what he intendeth by it; yea, he may complain of the burthen, and cry out under the preſſure, yet not know it at that time for his own good, for his humbling or purging. The Prophet ſaith concerning <hi>Ephraim, (Hoſ.</hi> 7.9.) <hi>Strangers have devoured his ſtrength, and he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it not:</hi> That is, Enemies have ſwallowed up, or taken away that wealth, thoſe riches, they have ſubdued thoſe Armies, thoſe Forces, which he looked upon, and boaſted of, as his ſtreng<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h; they have broken him quite with Warrs &amp; Invaſions, yet <hi>Ephraim</hi> knew it not: and not only ſo, but as it followeth, <hi>Yea, Gray hairs are here and there upon him;</hi> that is, he hath many Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes or Signs or ruine and deſtruction, <hi>yet he knoweth it not.</hi> Grief of heart for great changes in our Eſtate, change the hair; many grow gray with ſorrow. So that, when 'tis ſaid gray hairs are upon him, 'tis an alluſion taken from the Body Natural to the Body Politick; for as when the natural Body of a man hath gray hairs appearing, or (as <hi>Solomon</hi> allegorizeth, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12.5.) <hi>when the Almond Tree flouriſheth,</hi> it is an argument that old Age and infirmities are coming upon him (Gray hairs tell us that Death and the Grave are not farr off, they ſignifie ſome decay of nature.) Now as the natural Body hath its gray hairs, ſo a Politick Body, the body of a State hath its gray hairs too; that is, ſomthing may come upon a State, which ſheweth that it is declining and waxing old, that it is ready to break, and go to the Grave. I ſhall not ſtay to enquire what are the gray hairs of a Nation; I only bring that Scripture, to prove that many are inſenſible of the hand of God; <hi>he viſiteth in his anger, yet</hi> man, poſſibly a good man, <hi>knoweth it not,</hi> as <hi>Ephraim</hi> knew not of his gray hairs.</p>
                  <p>But did not <hi>Ephraim</hi> know his affliction? or did not <hi>Job</hi> know his? what is it to know, or who may be ſaid to know an affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, they only know their afflictions, or that God is viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his anger,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, who labour to find out the cauſe of Gods viſitation. If we feel the afflicting hand of God upon us, and enquire not, whence is this? why is it ſo? what hath moved or provoked the Lord to this manner of proceeding with us? If, I ſay, we make not ſuch enquiries, we are viſited in anger, and know it not. And therefore in that caſe, the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> exhorts the afflicted, captivated
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:48335:70"/> Church of the <hi>Jewes</hi> in <hi>Babylon, to ſearch and try their wayes,</hi> (Lam. 3.41.) that is, to conſider why it was ſo with them, what was the cauſe of their captivity. Till we ſit down and make dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent ſearch, why we are viſited, why any affliction or calamity is upon our Perſons and Families, or upon the Kingdomes and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions reſpectively where we live, we know neither the day of our viſitation, nor what our viſitation is. Then only we know Gods viſitation, when we are ſtudying the cauſes of it;<note place="margin">Scire eſt per cauſas ſcire.</note> 
                     <hi>To know a thing is to know it in the cauſes of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, They may be ſaid to know the viſitation of the Lord, that are ſtudying, as the cauſe which they have given, ſo the ends and purpoſes which God hath in viſiting them; for how much ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we find and ſee the cauſes of an affliction, yet till our hearts are drawn out to anſwer the ends of it, we do not truly know it.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, what are the uſual ends which the Lord hath in afflicting his people?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Firſt, to turn them from ſin; Secondly, to unglew and wean them from the world; Thirdly, that they may live nearer to, or more with him; Fourthly, that they may live more unto him, or (w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> takes in both the latter ends) that they may enjoy him more while they live, &amp; honour him more with their lives. Now (I ſay) till we are upon this kind of ſtudy, both of the cauſes of our viſitation, and the ends of it, &amp; beg that we may both remove thoſe cauſes, &amp; comply with or anſwer thoſe ends, we may be ſaid not to know the viſitation of the Lord, though it be, and we are, in great extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.

How many are there, who neither endeavour to ſearch out the cauſes, nor to fulfil the ends for which the Lord vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiteth them in his anger! I conceive this aſſertion, or ſuppoſition at leaſt of <hi>Elihu</hi>'s concerning <hi>Job,</hi> both as to his not truſting God in his affliction, and not knowing his viſitation, was, though in part true, and occaſion'd on <hi>Jobs</hi> part, yet over-harſh and ſevere: nor was the inference which he made from it in the next verſe, leſs ſevere and harſh.</p>

                  <p>Some connect this verſe with the former, according to the firſt reading of it, before mentioned, that giving a reaſon of this; But now his anger (or he in anger) hath viſited thee but a little, or nothing, <hi>&amp;c. Therefore thou, O Job, openeſt thy mouth in vain.</hi> As if he had ſaid, <hi>Becauſe the anger of God hath not puniſhed Job ſharply enough, nor in proportion to the multitude and greatneſs of his ſins, therefore he ſpeaks thus boldly and raſhly.</hi>

                  <q>Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To open the mouth</hi> is a Pariphraſis of ſpeaking; As if he had ſaid, therefore <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks in vain.

<q>He multiplieth words without knowledge.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here is another hard cenſure, upon this good, this holy, and wiſe man <hi>Job.</hi> Some Expoſiters fall heavy upon <hi>Elihu,</hi> as charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Job</hi> too far; he ſpake (ſay they) many things that were right, but not rightly; he ſpake many things that were true, but he did not ſpeak truly in fixing them upon <hi>Job;</hi> he ſpake all uprightly, but ſomewhat too rigorouſly: And indeed, if he had charged him ſo far, as to ſay, he had no knowledge at all, and had not opened his mouth at all to purpoſe, he had charged him beyond both truth and modeſty. But <hi>Elihu,</hi> who was ſet up by God for this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry end to humble <hi>Job,</hi> had ground to tell him, that as to ſome things, he had both <hi>opened his mouth in vaine, and multiplied words without knowledge;</hi> that is, he had ſpoken many words which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to proceed from any ſound or well-grounded knowledge; and I may give a four-fold ground of it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe he had not ſufficiently attended and magnified the Soveraignty of God, in laying thoſe afflictions upon him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Becauſe he had not, as he ought, ſate down quietly under the hand of God; but often called to know the cauſe, and that God would plainly tell him the reaſon, or give him an account why he ſuffered: Whereas he ſhould have remembred, that as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the judgements of God are unſearchable, and his wayes paſt finding out by man, ſo he hath reſerved ſome of them as ſecrets in his own breaſt, and will no more give any man an account of them, than any man ought to deſire an account of them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Becauſe he had not more conſidered his ſin, or had not been ſo much in conſidering the greatneſs of his ſin, as he had been in ſetting forth the greatneſs of his integrity. For though it were true which <hi>Job</hi> ſpake, <hi>that his way was upright,</hi> and though God had given teſtimony to his uprightneſs and integrity in all his wayes, yet he ſhould not have inſiſted ſo much upon that poynt, which had ſo much affinity with ſelf-boaſting, though he intended it only for ſelf clearing, or for the righting of himſelf. It had been
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:48335:72"/> more becoming him to have been aggravating his ſin, than ſetting forth his righteouſneſs; this was the poynt that <hi>Elihu</hi> ſtruck at, that he had juſtified himſelf too much, and judged himſelf too little. Yea <hi>Job</hi> was convinced of this at laſt, <hi>Once have I ſpoken, but I will ſpeak no more,</hi> that is, <hi>of my own integrity,</hi> or righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, He may be ſaid to have multiplied words without knowledge, becauſe he had ſpoken ſo much in the aggravation of his afflictions: 'Tis true, his afflictions were very great; yet <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hu</hi> cenſures him deſervedly, becauſe he took too much notice of them, complaining often and often, how heavy the hand of God was upon him, yea that God was an enemy to him; whereas he ſhould rather have lookt upon the viſitation of God, as light and eaſie,<note place="margin">Inſcritam ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jicit quod pug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantia, ſaliem non ſatis inter ſe cohaerentia conjunaeit. <hi>Merl:</hi>
                     </note> or (at leaſt) as but little comparatively, to what the Lord was able to lay upon him, or what his ſin might juſtifie God in laying upon him. <hi>Elihu</hi> having obſerved <hi>Job</hi> often and long ſtriking upon that ſtring, hightning his ſufferings and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, had reaſon enough not only to call him off from it, but to check him for it. And therefore let us remember and be admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, that in all our afflictions we ſhould not ſo much ſet forth the greatneſs of our ſuffering, as the greatneſs of the mercy of God; we ſhould look upon little mercies as great, (it ſhews an excellent ſpirit, when we heighten and greaten the mercy and goodneſs of God, even in little things) but we ſhould ſpeak of, and look upon our greateſt chaſtenings and afflictions as light, and little. <hi>Job</hi> fayled ſomewhat in all theſe things, and in ſome of them his faylings were great; and upon ſome of, if not upon all theſe grounds, I judge <hi>Elihu</hi> gave this judgement upon <hi>Job; He openeth his mouth in vaine, and multiplieth words without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> alſo yeilded himſelf thus faulty at laſt (<hi>Chap.</hi> 42.3.) <hi>Who is he</hi> (there he ſpeaks of himſelf in a third perſon, <hi>Who is he) that hideth counſel without knowledge; therefore have I uttered that I underſtood not, things too wonderfull for me, which I knew not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall cloſe my thoughts upon this Chapter, with minding the Reader: Firſt, of <hi>Elihu</hi> his candedneſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>owards <hi>Job,</hi> beyond what he found from his other friends; for <hi>Elihu</hi> chargeth <hi>Job</hi> here, only with vanity and inadvertency, not with any premeditated
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:48335:72"/> wickedneſs or blaſphemy, as <hi>Eliphaz</hi> had done, (<hi>Chap.</hi> 22.13, 14.) Secondly, let me mind the Reader, of that liberty and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpeech which <hi>Elihu</hi> uſed towards <hi>Job,</hi> in telling him of, and cenſuring him for his faylings; as alſo of that patience, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and equanimity, with which <hi>Job</hi> heard, received, and bare his ſharpeſt cenſures, not replying one word in paſſion, nor ſo much as pleading the leaſt excuſe for his former paſſionateneſs, but taking all in good part, and, doubtleſs, improving all for his ſpirituall profit.</p>

                  <p>In this copious Diſcourſe or long Oration, <hi>Elihu</hi> brings not any new aſſertion, or ſaying of <hi>Job,</hi> to be proved againſt him, nor doth he reprove <hi>Job</hi> for any new fault, but inſiſts upon the proof of what himſelf had aſſerted before, to ſhew that God is righteous, or to maintain the righteouſneſs of God; which he doth variouſly by looking through the various works of God, thoſe eſpecialy which are wrought on high, the Meteors of the aiery region, the

                     </note> the aim or tendency of which is to gain <hi>Jobs</hi> attention and ſubſcription to what he had to ſay, and he ſuggeſteth four Arguments or Motives in theſe three Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, to draw out the attention of <hi>Job,</hi> and likewiſe to gain his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to what he ſhould lay before him.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, He gives him an Argument from his intended brevity, I'le be ſhort, I mean not to be tedious, I will not tire thee, nor wear out thy patience with a long Diſcourſe: <hi>Suffer me a little.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His ſecond Argument is taken from the greatneſs of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in whoſe name and behalf he was about to ſpeak: As if he had ſaid, Hear me, for it is not my own Cauſe, nor the Cauſe of any man that I have in hand, I ſpeak for God, <hi>Suffer me a little, and I will ſhew thee, what I have yet to ſay for God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His third Argument is taken from the Authority in which he would ſpeak. Hear me diligently, for what I have to ſay,<note place="margin">Nihil vulgar: nihil non mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num dic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Fourthly, Which is a neceſſa y Conſequent of the former two, he would be heard, becauſe he reſolved (and hoped he ſhould make good that reſolu ion) to ſpeak the truth, and nothing but the truth; he offers this at the 4th Verſe, <hi>For truly my words

As if he had ſaid, <hi>My wrath ſhall not abide, it ſhall not laſt long, nor continue upon my People; and when I have done with them, it ſhall be turned upon their enemies and oppreſſors, the Aſſyrians, and towards them it ſhall not ceaſe, till they are utterly overturned.</hi> Take one inſtance more in the ſame Prophet, nearer the buſineſſe of the Text in <hi>Job. (Iſa.</hi> 28.10, 11.) <hi>Line upon Line, Precept upon Precept, here a Little, and there a Little,</hi> or <hi>now a little, and then a little.</hi> They ſhall not be overburdened, they ſhall have it by drops, by inch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, by little and little, as they are able to bear; juſt as children and young Novices are taught, who cannot receive much at once, but now a letter and then a letter, now a rule, and then a rule.
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:48335:74"/> Poſſibly <hi>Elihu</hi> perceived <hi>Job</hi> was not in a caſe to hear much, and therefore condeſcending to his weak condition by reaſon of his long ſufferings, he ſaith to him, <hi>Suffer me a little.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet further, I conceive, when <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith to <hi>Job, Suffer me a little,</hi> it may ſignifie one of theſe two things, or both of them. Firſt, That <hi>Job</hi> had given him ſome interruption as he was ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before. It is uſual with us, if when a man is ſpeaking, any interpoſe, to ſay, <hi>Pray ſuffer me a while,</hi> you ſhall have your liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to object or reply what you pleaſe when I have done. Secondly, That he had ſhewed ſome diſſatisfaction with what <hi>Elihu</hi> had ſpoken fully out, or when he had done ſpeaking, and therefore he deſired that he might further cleer the matter, and ſpeak out his mind, yet, at leaſt, a little more, if it might be to his full ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and the removal of all his doubts. <hi>Suffer me a little.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lay all theſe things together, and they will teach us a poynt of prudence, ſo to compoſe and compact what we have to ſay, that it may not be grievous or burthenſome to thoſe that hear us, eſpecially not to thoſe who (as <hi>Job</hi> was) are already grieved in mind, or body, or both. As the Spirit of God, leſt the Faith and Patience of his People ſhould fail in ſufferings, telleth, yea aſſureth them, it is but a little while that they ſhall ſuffer; relief, or deliverance, and which is more, the Reliever, the Deliverer, is making haſt towards them, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 10.27.) <hi>Yet a little while, and he that ſhall come, will come, and will not tarry;</hi> as the Spirit of God (I ſay) doth thus nurſe up the Faith of his People in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering times: ſo we had need to nurſe up the attentions of our Hearers at all times, but then chiefly when they are under any kind of ſuffering, and ſay, yet a little, ſuffer us a little, we will not burthen you much. There are two things of admirable uſe in ſpeaking. Firſt, Brevity. Secondly, Perſpicuity. 'Tis true, that they that ſtrive to be ſhort, prove very obſcure; yet doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, 'tis no very hard thing, in moſt matters, to joyn perſpicuity with brevity, and to give a clear ſenſe in a few words. And though it be a truth, That when we have ſaid much of God, and of the things of God, we have ſaid but little, yea, that when we have ſpoken our all, there remains infinitely more to be ſpoken, yet we ſhould as much as may be, aim at brevity, eſpecially where the Perſon ſpoken to is weak, and unfitted by bodily indiſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to hear much. <hi>Suffer me a little,</hi>

                  <p>For if, Firſt, it be a great honour to know God, and to have God made known to us; <hi>He hath not dealt ſo with any Nation</hi> (as he dealt with the <hi>Jews,</hi> in giving them the knowledge of his mind) <hi>and as for his Judgements they have not known them,</hi> (Pſal. 147.20.)</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If it be a greater honour to believe, and obey ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what we know, then</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, When we know, when we believe and obey, our greateſt honour of all is to plead for, and ſtand up in Gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, to undertake (being called) the defence of his truth and of his wayes, to <hi>contend earneſtly for the Faith, once</hi> (by God) <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the Saints,</hi> which is indeed the only good contention. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith (<hi>Phil.</hi> 1.17.) <hi>I am ſet for the defence of the Goſpel.

                     </gap>hing needs a fuller meaſure of defence for God, than the Truth of God; and we never ſtand up ſo fully on Gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, as when we ſtand for his Truth, though <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ur ſelves fall. To ſpeak and do on Gods behalf, is moſt for our own behoof, though we get but ſmall fees or wages, yea though we loſe our all in this world for ſuch ſpeaking and doing. I could wiſh there were not too much cauſe of complaint, that God hath not many to ſpeak on his behalf, and that Chriſt Jeſus, our great, our only Advocate with God, hath few Advocates among men. When God as it were calls to us, <hi>Who is on my ſide? who?</hi> Truly there are but few that will appear for him, that is, for Truth, for Holineſs, for holy Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; few appear for theſe things when differences ariſe about them. The corrupt part of the world in any Age will not, and the better part are not ſo free as they ought, to ſpeak and appear (in ſuch Caſes) on Gods behalf. <hi>The world</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>John</hi> in the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation) wondred after the Beaſt;</hi> &amp; he cannot want Advocates, who hath ſo many Admirers. But as the Admirers, ſo the Advocates
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:48335:76"/> of the Lamb are not many, they are only a ſealed, a ſelected Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. We can be very warm in ſpeaking in our own Cauſe, and on our own behalf; but how cold and dead-hearted are we when we come to ſpeak in the behalf of God! what a ſad withdrawing is there from that duty! God ſtands up often on the behalf of his People, and owns them in their need, yet few own God, or the Truth of God, when there is moſt need. Remember, as it is our honour, ſo our duty to ſpeak on Gods behalf; and they will come to a bad reckoning at laſt both for their doings and ſpeakings, for the work both of hand and tongue, who have done and ſpoken much in their own behalf, and little or nothing on Gods.</p>
                  <p>Again, As <hi>Elihu</hi> makes this an Argument to provoke <hi>Job</hi> to hear him patiently,</p>
                  <p>Note,
<q>They that ſpeak for God, ought to have audience.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is an Argument commanding attention, to ſay, I ſpeak from God, or for God. As when the Lord himſelf ſpeaks, all ought to hear; even thoſe things that have no ears, are call'd upon to hear him ſpeaking, or what is ſpoken from him, <hi>Hear O Heavens, and hearken O Earth,</hi> ſaith the Lord (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.2.) Now, as when the Lord ſpeaks all ſhould hear, ſo all ſhould hear when any thing is ſpoken on the Lords behalf; they that ſpeak for the Lord in truth, ſpeak alſo fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> the Lord. As truth bears the ſtamp and Image of God, ſo it tends to the glory of God. To reſiſt the truth of God, ſpoken by a true Meſſenger, is to refuſe the God of truth, (<hi>Luke</hi> 10.16.) <hi>He that heareth you, heareth me, and he that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me.</hi> Not to hear thoſe that ſpeak for the Lord, and from the Lord, is indeed not to hear the Lord, and ſo they will be judged in the great day.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, In that <hi>Elihu</hi> gathers up his Spirits, girds up the Loins of his mind upon this conſideration, that he was to ſpeak on Gods behalf,</p>
                  <p>Note,
<q>They who ſpeak for God, may ſpeak with courage, and be bold.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>If any thing can encourage us to, and in a work, 'tis this, that we engage for God. That which puts ſpirit and life into us, is our
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:48335:76"/> end and deſign in doing or ſpeaking; now this is the higheſt end or deſign, to argue for God; and therefore it may put the higheſt life, and livelieſt ſpirits into man, it may make him that is weak, ſtrong as a Gyant, and him that is fearful, bold as a Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when he can ſpeak in truth, that he is ſpeaking truth on Gods behalf.</p>
                  <q>I will ſhew thee that I have yet to ſpeak.</q>
                  <p>That word <hi>(yet)</hi> hath a great Emphaſis in it; he had been ſpeaking in Gods behalf before, and ſayes he, <hi>I have yet to ſpeak</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerve,
<q>They that truly begin to ſpeak for God, will perſevere in ſpeaking for God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As when we have ſpoken our all of God, and for God, there is yet more to be ſpoken of him, and for him (God is an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Argument, a Subject that can never be finiſhed) ſo they who have begun (with an honeſt heart and right aims) to ſpeak for God, will hold on and never give over to ſpeak for him, while they have a call to it. A ſoul toucht with true zeal, finds it hard to make an end, when once he hath begun ſo good, and ſo honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a ſervice, as to ſpeak for God. So much of the ſecond Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument uſed by <hi>Elihu</hi> to gain attention: <hi>Suffer me a little, and I will ſhew thee what I have yet to ſpeak on Gods behalf.</hi> He ſpake for God. The third followeth.</p>

                     </note> There are four notions under which knowledge may be ſaid to be fetcht from afar.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That's knowledge <hi>from afar,</hi> which is of things out of ſight, or inviſible, of things which not only are not, but cannot be ſeen. As if <hi>Elihu</hi> had ſaid, <hi>I will not diſcourſe about ſuch things as fall under common ſenſitive obſervation, I will not ſpeak of eye-objects, but of that and ſuch things, as no eye hath ſeen, nor can ſee,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:48335:77"/> of God, and of Divine things, the things of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>From afar,</hi> may imply this, I will not treat about matters of a late Date or Edition, but of things done long ſince. Thus <hi>David</hi> prefac'd his Speech, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.2, 3.) <hi>I will open my mouth in a Parable, I will utter dark ſayings of old, which we have heard, and known, and our Fathers have told us.</hi> Such things are far off from us, which were tranſacted and done a great while ago, or in former Ages, or in the firſt Age. As if <hi>Elihu</hi> had ſaid, <hi>I'le fetch my knowledge, not from yeſterday, but from ancient times, from the very beginning of the Creation, or from the Foundation of the world;</hi> ſuch things are truly afar off; or, <hi>I will fetch my knowledge from thoſe things which were before the beginning;</hi> that's more truly afar off. Thus a Learned Tranſlater gloſſeth upon the Text,<note place="margin">Prout res fuit non tantum in de a ſeculis, ſed etiam ante om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia ſecula. <hi>Jun.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>I will ſpeak even of thoſe things which were before any thing viſible was, even from Eternity.</hi> The things of Eternity are moſt proper to ſet forth and illuſtrate the honour of God, and moſt lively expreſſe his Power and Divine Perfections.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, When he ſaith, <hi>I will fetch my knowledge from afar;</hi> the meaning may be this, It ſhall be of admirable and ſublime things,<note place="margin">Ex operibus Dei admiran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis et ſublimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus. <hi>Merc.</hi>
                     </note> the reaſon of which could not eaſily be given, nor preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly found out. Thoſe things are far from us, which we cannot dive into, nor reach, nor fathome the bottome of, by the Line of our underſtanding: Such are the ſecret Counſels of God before the world was, and ſome wayes of his Providence in dealing with men ever ſince the world was, which are therefore ſaid to be unſearchable, and paſt finding out; and of theſe <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeaks at large in this Chapter, to the 26th verſe.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>I will fetch my knowledge from afar,</hi> may be thus underſtood, I will ſpeak to thee of things which I have much ſtudied for; I will not ſpeak what comes next, nor what lyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt,<note place="margin">Ex ramotis ſed neceſſariis principiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gam, non no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viter excogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tata ſeda prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipio cognita, et accuratè pare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditata pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeram. <hi>Scult.</hi>
                     </note> but will beat my brains for what I ſay, in moſt ſerious meditation; I will not offer thee any raw or undigeſted ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but ſhall well and maturely conſider before I ſpeak; nor will I ſpeak what my weak reaſon only tells me is true, but what by light from above, and I hope by me ſpecial teachings of God, I know to be true: I will fetch my knowledge, or that which I make know, from the depths of my heart, not from ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den flaſhes and conceits of my head. In all theſe ſenſes poſſibly <hi>Elihu</hi> was reſolved to fetch his knowledge from afar, he would
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:48335:77"/> not take up, nor trouble <hi>Job</hi> with things that were obvious, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, or eaſie to be had, but bring what he had to ſay out of the cloſeſt Cabinets, and utter conceptions, which were moſt remote from the common road.</p>

                  <p>And the reaſon why <hi>Job</hi> was here charged by <hi>Elihu</hi> as a perſon not giving righteouſneſs to God, was, becauſe he did not ſit down quietly and patiently under his hand in ſufferings, but muttered and complained as a man unſatisfied with, though he did not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly murmur againſt the dealings of God with him.

Further, to aſcribe righteouſneſs to God, is to juſtifie him, though he give never ſo much proſperity to unjuſt and wicked men (<hi>Jer.</hi> 12.1.) <hi>Righteous art thou, O Lord, when I plead with thee; yet let me talke with thee of thy judgements.

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:48335:81"/> any earthly Judge, though Supream, or moſt Superiour, ſhould turn aſide the right of a man, how inferiour ſoever; for, as the 36<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe hath it, <hi>To ſubvert a man in his Cauſe, the Lord approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not;</hi> or, as the Hebrew is rendred, <hi>ſeeth not,</hi> that is, he ſeeth it not with approbation, but indeed with deteſtation, and will ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely puniſh ſuch ſubverters of Juſtice. Secondly, It is impoſſible that he who hath made us ſhould wrong or injure us, upon the principle of his Soveraignty over all thoſe whom he hath made. He that gives all men their being, he that gives all to all men that are in being, can be unrighteous to no man, whatſoever he taketh from him, or doth with him. We have <hi>Job</hi> in the beginning of this Book (<hi>Chap.</hi> 1.21.) aſcribing righteouſneſs to God his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker upon this reaſon, or principle, <hi>The Lord hath given, and the Lord hath taken away; bleſſed be the Name of the Lord.</hi> It is he that made me a man, 'tis he who once made me a rich man, a great man, <hi>the greateſt man of all the men of the Eaſt,</hi> (Chap. 1.3.) What if now he hath leſſened me, and left me little or nothing? what if he hath now made me a mean man, a poor man (in account) a no man? what if God hath now ſtript me naked, and taken all from me? He hath taken nothing but what he gave; why then ſhould I take it ill at his hands, or have ſo much as an ill thought of him? the Lord gives, and the Lord takes; there's no unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs in all this. If God ſhould utterly undoe us, he doth us no wrong; if he ſhould as it were, unmake us, let us conſider he is our Maker, &amp; then we muſt ſay, there is no unrighteouſneſs in him, yea we ſhall be ready (with <hi>Elihu</hi> in the Text) to aſcribe righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto him. And therefore, as a Corollary from the whole,</p>
                  <p>Note, Fifthly;
<q>Whatſoever God doth with us, or others, we ought to maintain the honour of God, and retain good thoughts of him, both as righteous and good.</q>

                  <p>Fourthly, When he ſaith, <hi>Truly, my words ſhall not be falſe,</hi> we may take it two wayes: Firſt, As to the matter ſpoken; Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, As to the mind of the Speaker: when truth is thus ſpoken, tis truly ſpoken; thus much <hi>Elihu</hi> engag'd for: As if he had ſaid, <hi>The matter that I ſpeak, ſhall be true, and I will ſpeak it in truth, or with a true mind and heart; I will not ſpeak any thing to flatter thee, nor for my own ends, to trouble thee; my words ſhall be candid and ſincere, as well as found and orthodox: I will ſpeak the truth, and ſpeak it in truth.</hi> Some ſpeak that which is falſe (as I may ſay) in the ſincerity of their heart, thinking it to be true; and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:48335:82"/> others ſpeak truth in the falſeneſs of their heart, that is, they have ſome by ends in ſpeaking it; from both thoſe <hi>Elihu</hi> here clears himſelf, and with both theſe <hi>Job</hi> had taxed his Friends, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.7. <hi>Chap.</hi> 17.5.</p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve;
<q>It is the higheſt Commendation of a Speaker, to ſpeak truth, and the higher the Truth, the higher the Commendation of the Speaker.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Words can have no greater beauty, nor richer ornament, than Truth, and Truth is never more adorn'd, than by plainneſs of Speech, nor more beautiful, than when (like our firſt Parents in innocency) 'tis naked. To ſpeak <hi>truly,</hi> is much more honourable, than to ſpeak <hi>eloquently;</hi> one plain word of plain truth, is better than a long painted Oration, tinctured with the leaſt errour: What then are long Orations, and large Volumes, which have, upon the matter, as many errours as words, as many lyes and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, as Periods and Sentences! at beſt, ſome in putting off their words, do as others in putting off their wares, mingle good and bad together. 'Tis dangerous to make ſuch medlies. As we muſt not put bad for good, darkneſs for light, bitter for ſweet, falſhood for Truth, ſo we muſt not blend or put bad among the good, nor mix darkneſs with light, nor falſhood with Truth. And as 'tis dangerous to mix any falſhood of Doctrine with Truth, ſo to mix falſhood of Heart, with Truth of Doctrine, or to ſpeak Truth, but not in truth. The Apoſtle is zealous in proteſting againſt falſhood, and profeſſing for the Truth, in both theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects; Firſt, as to the truth of the Doctrine, or of the matter ſpoken, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.17.) <hi>We are not as many, which corrupt</hi> (or deal deceitfully with) <hi>the Word of God;</hi> we do not adulterate or mix it with our own imaginations or inventions; which he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirms (<hi>Chap.</hi> 4.2.) <hi>We have renounced the hidden things of diſhoneſty, &amp;c.</hi> Secondly, As he ſpake truth of Doctrine, ſo he ſpake it in the truth of his heart, as he aſſured the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> in both the places laſt mentioned; we are, not only no corrupters of the Word of God, <hi>but as of ſincerity</hi> (there's truth of heart) <hi>as of God, in the ſight of God, ſpeak we in Chriſt.</hi> And again, <hi>We walk not in craftineſs, nor handle the Word of God deceitfully, but by manifeſtation of the truth, commend our ſelves to every mans Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:48335:82"/> in the ſight of God.</hi> He makes a proteſt yet once more in the ſame tenour, and ſomewhat higher, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.8.) <hi>We can do nothing againſt the Truth;</hi> O bleſſed Impotency! <hi>but for the Truth;</hi> O bleſſed Ability! Who would not be weak againſt the Truth? who would not be ſtrong for the Truth, which is ſtrongeſt of all, and will prevail? And as we ſhould ſpeak nothing againſt the Truth, ſo nothing but the Truth, nothing beſide the Truth, nothing that may be any blemiſh, or turn to the leaſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervice of the Truth; yea, though it ſhould be (as we hope) for the ſervice of that excellent and amiable thing called <hi>Peace;</hi> a thing ſo excellent, that we cannot over-bid, nor pay too much for it, unleſs we part with, and pay away truth for it: and if ever we do ſo, we over-bid for it, and over-buy it indeed, and ſhall have cauſe at laſt to repent of our bargain, and cry out, <hi>we have burnt our Fingers,</hi> and it would be well if that were all. Therefore let us remember the Lords admonition by his Prophet (<hi>Zech.</hi> 8.19.) <hi>Love the Truth and Peace:</hi> Firſt, Truth, then Peace. Nor was there ever any true Lover of Truth, that was not alſo a Lover of Peace; nor any true Lover of Peace, but was ſuch a Lover of Truth, that he could lay down, or let go, his Peace for it. One of the Ancients tells us,<note place="margin">Tantus ſit in te veritatis amor, ut quicquid di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xeris, juratum putes. <hi>Hieron.</hi>
                     </note> There ought to be ſo great a love of Truth in us, that, whatſoever we ſay to be true, ſhould be as much as if we had ſworn it to be true, or had delivered it upon Oath. There is no more goodneſs in what we ſay, than there is Truth in what we ſay. A Lye in report or Diſcourſe, and a Lye in Doctrine or Diſpute, are both abominable to God, and ſhould be ſo to man; therefore <hi>Elihu</hi> heartily diſclaims it, <hi>Truly my words ſhall not be falſe.</hi>

'tis as if <hi>Elihu</hi> had ſaid, <hi>Thou hadſt need, O Job, look to thy ſelf, and diligently attend to what is ſpoken, for thou hast not to do with man, with one like thy ſelf only, but thou haſt to do with God.</hi> Some inſiſt much, yea, altogether upon this Interpretation of the word; <hi>God is with thee,</hi> therefore receive truth; God cannot be deceiv'd, nor doth he deceive, therefore hearken and obey. Yet <hi>Elihu</hi> might ſpeak thus with reſpect to the meſſage brought by himſelf; for when man ſpeaking in the Name of God ſpeaks the mind of God to us, it may be ſaid, God is with us, and ſpeaks to us by him. The Apoſtle ſaith (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5.) <hi>If any require a Sign or Token of Chriſt ſpeaking in me.</hi> Chriſt ſpeaks, while his Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and Miniſters ſpeak truth. The ſame Apoſtle teſtified of the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> that they took his ſpeaking as Gods ſpeaking, (1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.13.) <hi>When ye received the Word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of man, but (as it is in truth) the Word of God.</hi> And therefore I conceive we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the words of <hi>Elihu</hi> concerning <hi>Elihu</hi> himſelf, yet not as in himſelf, but as fitted for, and aſſiſted in the work by God, <hi>He that is perfect in knowledge is with thee;</hi> As if he had ſaid, <hi>Though I am but a young man, yet thou haſt not to deal with an ignorant man, with one who is but a novice or ſmatterer in the things of God, with one that is yet in the Elements of Divine knowledge and learning; He that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.</hi> And it is conceiv'd that <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeaks thus in the third perſon for Modeſties ſake, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> alſo did (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.2, 3.) <hi>I knew a man in Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> He doth not ſay, I <hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>caught up to the third Heaven, and heard unſpeakable words, &amp;c.</hi> but I knew ſuch a man. Thus <hi>Elihu</hi> here; and doub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>leſs, he had been lyable to cenſure, as ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogating too much to himſelf, had he ſpoken in the firſt perſon, <hi>I that am perfect in knowledge am with thee:</hi> Therefore he covers and conceals himſelf by expreſſing it in the third perſon, <hi>He that is perfect in knowledge is with thee;</hi> that is, He that is with thee to convince thee of thy former errour, and to give thee better coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, <hi>is perfect in knowledge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But is that true? was <hi>Elihu,</hi> or is any man perfect in <hi>knowledge,</hi> or (as the Hebrew ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h it plurally) in <hi>knowledges,</hi> that is, in all kinds of knowledge, or in all the degrees of knowledge of any kind? Surely, No man is perfect in the knowledge of any one thing, much leſs of all things, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.9, 12.) <hi>We know in
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:48335:83"/> part, and propheſie in part, we ſee but darkly, &amp;c.</hi> How then can it be ſaid of <hi>Elihu, He is perfect in knowledge?</hi> I anſwer; There is a twofold perfection. Firſt, Abſolute. Secondly, Comparative. There's no man living here below hath abſolute perfection of knowledge; yet one man being compar'd with another, may be ſaid to be perfect in knowledge, another not: There are various degrees of knowledge in man; the higheſt degree of knowledge compar'd with the loweſt, may be call'd perfect knowledg. Thus we are to underſtand <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeaking at the rate of a creature, not of God, or as becomes and is commenſurable with the ſtate of man in this life, whoſe beſt perfection in knowledge, is to know his own imperfections.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeaks not of any perfection of knowledge, but of being perfect, that is, ſincere, in knowledge. As if he had ſaid, What I know, I know with an honeſt, upright heart and intention: I do not know to abuſe thee or others, I make not uſe of my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to deceive the ſimple, but to inform them. Some are crafty and cunning in knowledge, not perfect in it; they are knowing as the Devil is knowing, who takes his name <hi>Daemon</hi> from his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, yet he is not perfect, but corrupt in his knowledge, he is ſubtil, and full of devices to do miſchief with his knowledge. That's perfect knowledge, which is ſincerely imployed for the Glory of God, and the good of thoſe with whom we have to do. So then, the meaning of <hi>Elihu</hi> may be ſumm'd up thus in ſhort; <hi>He that is with thee</hi> (that is my ſelf) <hi>will deal with thee to the beſt of my underſtanding, and in the Integrity of my heart.</hi> This alſo ſuits well with the former part of the verſe, <hi>Truly my words ſhall not be falſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Note;

                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Though no man knoweth all things, yet ſome know much more than others.</q>

Some cannot underſtand wiſdome, when ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the perfect, they know not how to learn, yea, ſome (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.7.) <hi>are ever learning, but never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</hi> Others can <hi>ſpeak wiſdome among them that are perfect</hi> (2 Cor. 2.6.) that is, they are got
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:48335:84"/> to the higheſt Form of Goſpel knowledge, and are fit to be Teachers.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Note;
<q>Whether we know little or much, this is the perfection of our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, honeſtly to imploy and improve it, for the information of the ignorant, and the conviction of thoſe who are in errour.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we have but one Talent of knowledge, yet if we uſe it well, we are perfect in knowledge. They who have digged (as they think) to the heart, and dived to the bottom of all Sciences, yea into the heart of the Scriptures too, yet if they keep their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to themſelves, or know only for themſelves, if they have baſe ends and by reſpects, in vending their knowledge, if they trade with their knowledge for ſelf only, or to do miſchief to others, their knowledge is not only utterly imperfect, but, as to any good account, nothing, or none at all. As he that ſlothfully hides his Talent, ſo he, who either vain-gloriouſly ſhews it, or deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully uſeth it, ſhall be numbred among thoſe who have none, (<hi>Math.</hi> 25.29. <hi>Luke</hi> 8.18.)</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeaking of himſelf in a third perſon, Note,
<q>Modeſty is a great vertue, and the grace of all our Graces.</q>

                  <p>He that ſaith, I am perfect in knowledge, knoweth not what is neereſt him, himſelf. We ſhould uſe our knowledge as much as we can, but ſhew it as little as we can, unleſs in the uſing of it. 'Tis beſt for us to take little notice of our own goodneſs, and not to know our own knowledge. Uſually they have but little, who are much in ſhewing (unleſs much called to it) what they have. Empty Veſſels ſound moſt, and ſhallow Brooks make the loudeſt noyſe in paſſage. <hi>Moſes</hi> put a Vail upon his face, as unwilling to have that Divine beauty ſeen.

When God made a Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> he thus offers himſelf to his faith, though by another word in the Original, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1.) <hi>I am the Almighty God, walk before me, and be thou perfect,</hi> or upright, or ſincere, (as our Margin reads it) The ſame title is again repeated by <hi>Iſaac,</hi> when he diſpatcht his ſon <hi>Jacob</hi> with a bleſſing to <hi>Padan-Aram,</hi> to avoyd the fury of his brother <hi>Eſau,</hi> (Gen. 28.3.)

And he ſeems even to delight in this title, <hi>The mighty God of Jacob. Jacob</hi> was mighty with God in prayer, as a Prince he had power with God and prevailed; and God loved and loves to put forth his might for <hi>Jacob,</hi> his Church and people, in anſwer of their prayers. But I ſhall not ſtay in general upon this title, only open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it a little, ſhall make ſome inferences from it. <hi>God is mighty</hi> in a two-fold notion.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In authority, or in command; he commands in chief; God is Soveraigne and Supreame; the Legiſlative power is in his hand, he gives Lawes, and he gives the Law to all the world, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.11.) <hi>Once hath he ſpoken, and I heard it twice, that power</hi> (Soveraignity, Law-giving power) <hi>belongs to God;</hi> He is ſo mighty in this governing power, that he doth not only give Lawes to rule Nations, but he diſpoſeth of all the Rulers in Nations, (<hi>Daniel</hi> Chap. 2.21. Chap. 4.17.) And again, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.28.) <hi>The Kingdome is the Lords, and he is the Governour among the Nations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Beſides this power of Authority, which the Lord exerciſeth paramount over all the world, he hath alſo another power or might; he hath the might of Strength, as well as the might of Authority. Some have a great, a mighty Authority, but they have little or no might to make good that Authority; they cannot effect or carry on what they comm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nd, how much right ſoever they have to command, yea how juſt and right ſoever that is which they command: they have Authoritive might, yet want Executive might, they cannot bring about, nor iſſue what they determine. But when <hi>Elihu</hi> aſſerts, <hi>Behold, God is mighty,</hi> we are to take it under both notions, he is mighty, as he hath the whole Legiſlative power in his hand, and he is mighty, as having alſo the whole Executive power in his hand. The ſons of men are jealous about theſe two Powers, and labour to keep them in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct hands, that they who have the Legiſlative power, may not have the Executive power alſo, as fearing what they would do were they veſted with both: But God (beyond all diſpute) hath both powers in himſelf, and it is impoſſible they ſhould be taken from him, or devolved upon any others, otherwiſe than himſelf pleaſeth, or permitteth; behold and wonder, God is mighty,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:48335:85"/> (and O how mighty is God!) in the union of theſe two powers; and to ſet forth yet further the wonder of his might, I ſhall give you ſeaven brief propoſitions, or aſſertions, concerning the might of God, as it is twiſted and made up of theſe two mights or powers.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, He is ſo mighty both in ſtrength and power, that all the might which is in the creature, all the Legiſlative might, and all the Executive might, all the Authority, and all the ability which is in any man, is from him, and by him; that's it, which is ſaid, (<hi>Pro.</hi> 8.15.) <hi>By me Kings reigne, and Princes decree Juſtice;</hi> they have both their Authority, and their power to execute that Authority from me; every kind and degree of might (whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it is) is but a derivation, a rivolet, from the Might and Power of God, that's the fountaine, the ſpring of all.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Behold the mightineſs of God, as in giving, ſo in taking away power, whether the power of authority or of ſtrength, from the ſons of men; He taketh away might from the mighty. Sometimes ſuch power, ſuch authority, ſuch command is put into the hands of others, that they who put it there, know not how to get it out again, but are maſtered and over power'd with the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry power, which they truſt others with; but ſuch is the might of God, that whatever might of authority or ſtrength he hath truſted or cloathed any of the Princes or Powers of this world with, he can preſently take it out of their hands again, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 75.7.) <hi>God is the Judge, he putteth down one, and ſetteth up another;</hi> and it is as eaſie with him to put down, as it is to ſet up; as he can make the weak ſtrong, ſo he can preſently make the ſtrong weak; this is the glory of the might of God, he can take away power, as well as give it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Behold, God is mighty,</hi> for, <hi>he can do whatſoever pleaſeth him;</hi> Certainly, he is Almighty that can do ſo; He whoſe power runs paralel with his will, he who can act as far as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, how mighty is he! none of the mighty ones of this world can do this. Oh, what work would ſome men make in the world, if they could do as much as they deſire, if their power ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes extend, as far as, or be commenſurate with their Will; yet thus it is with God. The Scriptures of truth are clear in it, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 115.3.) where, when ſome prophane wretches had ſcoffed and jeered the people of God, wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h <hi>where is your God?</hi>
                     <pb n="162" facs="tcp:48335:86"/> they preſently anſwer, <hi>Our God is in heaven, and he hath done whatſoever pleaſeth him.</hi> It is not what this man pleaſeth, or what that man pleaſeth, or what this ſort or gange of men pleaſe, but what the Lord pleaſeth, that is done, (and that he doth well, how ill ſoever men do it) both in heaven and in earth. The Lord will not do all that he can, for he could by his power reduce this world to its firſt principles, a Chaos, or into a nothing, as it was before that, but he can do whatſoever he will; all things are poſſible to God, yea all things are eaſie, nothing hard or difficult to God: And we may very well put a <hi>behold</hi> of admiration upon his might (and ſuch is the might of God,) who can do whatſoever he willeth.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The Lord is ſo mighty, that <hi>he can do all, without the help of any.</hi> Some men are very mighty, but it is with other mens hands, with other mens ſtrength; let them alone, let them ſtand by themſelves, do but deſert and leave them, and what can they do? juſt nothing. But ſuch is the mightineſs of God, the Almightineſs of God, that if all ſecond cauſes, if all perſons, powers and Nations ſhould leave him, in that which he intends ſhould be done, he can do it himſelf without them. The Prophet ſetting forth the victory of Chriſt over his enemies, repreſents him ſpeaking thus, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.3.) <hi>I have trodden the wine-preſs alone, and of the people there was none with me.</hi> Which though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny interpret of his paſſive conqueſt by ſuffering as a Prieſt, yet moſt, of his active conqueſt as a King, which he uſually atchieveth by himſelf alone, without any appearance of help from man. And though <hi>Deborah</hi> in her Song (<hi>Judg.</hi> 5.) pronounceth a curſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe that came not out to help the Lord againſt the Mighty, yet it was not becauſe the mighty God needed their help or ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, but becauſe they did owe it him, &amp; in duty ſhould have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it him. For, that the Lord wants no help, is further clear from the Prophet, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.16.) <hi>He ſaw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no Interceſſor,</hi> (none ſo much as to ſpeak a word) <hi>therefore his arme wrought ſalvation, and his righteouſneſs it ſuſtained him.</hi> Not only, no arme was put forth to help, but no tongue ſo much as move or intercede for help to do it, yet his own arme did it. Thus the Prophet, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.24.) <hi>He ſtretcheth forth the Heavens alone, and laid the Foundations of the Earth by himſelf.</hi> Now as it was with the Lord in the work of Creation, he
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:48335:86"/> had no helper, no aſſiſtant, he did it alone by himſelf; ſo it is as true, as to all works of providence. Let all men forſake him (as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> complained they did him, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.16.) and no man ſtand by him, yet the Lord (what his purpoſe and counſel is) can bring to paſs alone: O behold this might! he can do all things without the help of any; and not only ſo, but</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, God is ſo mighty, that he can bring all things to paſs, or do what he pleaſeth, though all creatures ſhould be diſpleaſed, though all men and Angels, though all ſecond cauſes ſtand up to hinder and to ſtop him. The Lord can work his will againſt every will, againſt all contradictions and oppoſitions. Thus the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet extols the power of God, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 14.27.) <hi>The Lord of Hoſts hath purpoſed, and who ſhall d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſanul it? His hand is ſtretched out, and who ſhall turn it back?</hi> Where we have, firſt, the purpoſe of God, <hi>none can diſanull</hi> that; Secondly, the execution of that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <hi>He ſtretcheth out his hand</hi> (to do ſuch or ſuch a thing) <hi>who ſhall turn it back?</hi> Let all men and Devils joyn forces and counſels, let them ſtrive to do it, they ſhall not be able to do it. We have a like confeſſion, (<hi>Dan.</hi> 4.35.) <hi>He doth according to his will in the Armies of Heaven, and among the Inhabitants of the Earth, and none can ſtay his hand, or ſay to him, what doſt thou?</hi> Such is the mightineſs of God, that he can work, not only when the creature doth not help him, or when they apoſtatize from and deſert him or his intereſt, but though they ſet their hearts and heads, their hands, and their all againſt him, they cannot ſtay him, nor hinder his work; <hi>I</hi> (ſaith the Lord, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.13.) <hi>will work, and who ſhall let it?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Behold, how mighty the Lord is, he is ſo mighty, that he can do all theſe things, and never trouble himſelf in doing of them; he can do all things, and not be weary. We ſee the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſt among men, the Powers of this world, how they are toyled, and moyled, how they are worn out, how they ſweat and labour, and are ready to faint and tire, in b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>inging ſome poor buſineſs, ſome petty project about, or to its iſſue. But the greateſt deſignes which the Lord hath in his heart to do, he can do them, without any weariſomneſs or trouble at all, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.28.) <hi>Doſt not thou know that the Lord is not weary, neither doth he faint:</hi> and when the Prophet ſaith, <hi>the Lord is not weary, neither doth he faint,</hi> the meaning is not this, the Lord is ſomewhat weary, only
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:48335:87"/> he doth not faint, but the meaning is this, he hath not the leaſt weariſomneſs upon him, no more than a man hath in turning his hand; not only are all things poſſible to God, or ſuch as he can do, if he put forth the utmoſt of his power and ſtrength, if he make (as we ſay) much adoe, if he lay himſelf out to the full; not only are things thus poſſible to God, (which yet argueth wonderfull might) but behold, the Lord is ſo mighty, that there is nothing difficult unto him. Not only can he poſſibly do great things, but he can eaſily do them, he can do them without the leaſt trouble to himſelf: <hi>There is nothing hard to him, who can do every thing.</hi> Mighty men have done great things, but they will tell you they could hardly do them, they were forced to turn every ſtone, to ſtraine every veine of their hearts to do them; whereas the mighty God can do his work with as much eaſe, as deſire to have it done.</p>
                  <p>Seaventhly, Behold, God is mighty, ſo mighty that he can do any thing, but that which will argue that he is not almighty. The Scripture ſpeaks of ſomething which the Lord cannot doe, (<hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2.) <hi>In hope of eternal life, which God who cannot lye hath promiſed.</hi> And again, the Apoſtle ſaith of God, not only making promiſe but oath to <hi>Abraham, (Heb.</hi> 6.18.) <hi>That by two Immutable things, in which it is impoſſible for God to lye, the heirs of promiſe might have ſtrong conſolation.</hi> Once more, (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.13.) <hi>If we believe not, yet he abideth faithfull, he cannot deny himſelf.</hi> We have theſe and ſuch like negative Propoſitions concerning God, telling us what he cannot do. Now the only reaſon why it is ſaid, the Mighty God cannot do theſe things, is becauſe the doing of them would argue him not to be Almighty. To lye is to be weak; to deny himſelf would affirme his impotency, therefore he cannot do theſe things; the Lord is ſo mighty, ſo ſtrong, that it is impoſſible for him to do any thing, which ſhould declare any weakneſs or impotency in him. Thus I have given you ſeaven aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions concerning the might of God, all which may very well call for a <hi>behold</hi> of admiration and aſtoniſhment at the mightineſs of God. Take a few Inferences from this grand Aſſertion.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, For Comfort.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, For Terror. <hi>Behold,</hi> the Lord is Mighty, Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; this ſpeaks comfort to the people of God.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Surely then he can do whatſoever he hath promiſed to
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:48335:87"/> do, and if ſo, then look through the promiſes and ſee, whether God hath not promiſed, to do good things for his people in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and for every believer in particular; Behold, the Lord is mighty, theſe are not vaine words, he can fill up, and fulfill all his promiſes. As he hath made promiſes, ſo he can create per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances. <hi>Abraham</hi> was fully perſwaded that what he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed he was able to performe, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 4.21.)</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If the Lord be mighty in all thoſe notions fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhewed, then certainly he can do whatſoever we deſire him to do according to his will. As God hath not out-promiſed his power, ſo we cannot out-pray the power, nor out-ask the arme of God, we may quickly out-pray the power of man, and ask what he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do; he may ſay, I cannot do this for you, it is not in my power: but here is our comfort, if what we pray and ask be good for us to have, if it be juſt and righteous for him to do, let it be what it will, it is within the compaſſe of the power of God, who is alſo ready to performe it for us. The Apoſtle aſſureth us of this, (<hi>Eph.</hi> 4.20.) <hi>He is able to do for us abundantly, above what we ask or think;</hi> he cannot only do what we ask, but he can do above what we ask, yea, abundantly above what we ask. How narrow, and ſhort, and poor, are our words and prayers, compared with the power of God! He can do abundantly for us above what we ask, and not only ſo, but above what we think. If a man ſhould have ſomewhat in his mind, that he is not able to expreſs, (as the mind is far larger than the tongue,) if a man think what he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſpeak or utter, yet the Lord is of ſuch power, that he can do not only what we think, but abundantly above what we are able to think. How many requeſts do we put up daily to God in prayer for our perſons, for our families, for the Church of God, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Kingdoms of men, our own Kingdome eſpecially, is it not matter of ſingular comfort, that all theſe requeſts are before a Mighty God, a God who can quickly ſend down all our prayers in performances, and give us the fruit of all our askings? 'Tis an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Spring of comfort and encouragement unto the people of God, both in prayer and unto prayer; they pray to him who is <hi>mighty,</hi> mighty to do what they pray for.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If God be ſo mighty himſelf that he can do all things, then he is able to give us might to do what he requireth of us; if he be mighty enough to do what we ask, then he is mighty
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:48335:88"/> enough to enable us to do what he commands. We ask many things of God, God commands many things at our hands; when we ask, God is mighty to help us to what we ask; and if what we ask be what he commands us, he will ſurely help us to do what we ask, even whatſoever he commands us to do; he ſtrengthens his people with might by his Spirit in the inner man, (<hi>Eph.</hi> 3.16.) <hi>Paul</hi> could ſay, (<hi>Phil.</hi> 4.18.) <hi>I can do all things, through Chriſt ſtrengthening me;</hi> Chriſt hath ſtrength to do all things, and Chriſt can make me ſtrong (ſaith the Apoſtle) to do all things; Chriſt hath ſtrength to do all things that he hath a mind to do, and he is ſtrong to ſtrengthen us in and for the doing of all things, that are according to his mind.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, If God be thus mighty to do all things, if he hath all ſtrength, both commanding and executing ſtrength, then as he can give us ſtrength to do all things that he calls us to do, ſo he hath ſtrength enough to reward us for all we do for him; this is comfortable. Sometimes we work and labour for men, who are not able, they have little power, or if power enough, yet no will at all to reward us for it. But as the Lord is not unrighteous, to forget our labour, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 6.10.) ſo he is not unable, that is, he is infinitely able to reward us. We find the ſtrength of God ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of to this poynt, (<hi>Jer.</hi> 32.18, 19.) <hi>Thou ſheweſt loving kindneſs unto thouſands,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The great, the mighty God, the Lord of Hoſts is his Name; Great in counſel, and mighty in working, for thine eyes are open upon all the wayes of the ſons of men, to give every one according to his wayes, and according to the fruit of his doings.</hi> When the Prophet had aſſerted, <hi>God is mighty in working,</hi> he brings it down to this, he is mighty in rewarding us for all our works. Do not think (what labour ſoever you have taken for the Lord) that you ſhall want a reward, for the Lord hath treaſure and ſtore, ſtrength and power enough, to give you a ſufficient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence for all your labours.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, This truth is matter of comfort and encouragement in doing good, not only as 'tis a ſervice to God, but as it is a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to men, eſpecially to the poor, and more eſpecially to Gods poor. The mightineſs of God ſhould move us to be charitable, yea, liberall and bountifull in our charity. The Apoſtle uſeth this Argument, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.8.) for having ſaid, <hi>God loveth a chearfull giver,</hi> he preſently adds, <hi>God is able to make all grace abound
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:48335:88"/> towards you, that ye alwayes having all ſufficiency in all things, may abound in every good work.</hi> As if he had ſaid, Be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to give, nor ſparing in giving, for God (to whom you lend, when you give to the poor) is a good debter, a ſufficient pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter, and he will pay you, not only in your own, but in better coyne, than you lent: he will pay you in ſpiritualls for your tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralls, in grace for your gold, and that abundantly, both in the grace of his favour ſhining upon you, as alſo in the Graces of his Spirit working in you; yea, ye ſhall have, not only an All-ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency in ſpiritual things, but in all things, which muſt needs include temporal things; even your Gold and Silver will multiply as Seed, by ſowing and ſcattering it abroad (as he alludes in the 9t<hi rend="sup">h</hi> verſe) ſo that ye ſhall (through this ability of God) be enabled to abound in every good work, that is, every good work of Grace, in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; and if you are called to that ſpecial good work of Charity again and again, you ſhall be able to abound in every one of them. Some are doubtful, if they ſhould give freely and liberally, they ſhould loſe by it, and be ſtraitned themſelves: No, ſaith the Apoſtle, I avouch and engage the Almightineſs of God for it, if you be cheerful givers, God will ſhew his All-ſufficiency in giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you an All-ſufficiency in all things. Here are three or four <hi>Alls,</hi> promiſed to thoſe, who give but <hi>ſomwhat</hi> in a due manner. Here is, Firſt, <hi>all grace;</hi> Secondly, <hi>All-ſufficiency;</hi> Thirdly, in <hi>all things;</hi> and Fou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>thly, <hi>alwayes;</hi> and all theſe grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the mightineſs of God: <hi>God is able.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>God is mighty:</hi> Then he can protect us from, ſupport us under, or deliver us out of all thoſe dangers, which we incurre for his Names ſake, (<hi>Dan.</hi> 3.17.)</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Hence we may inferre matter of terrour to the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed world, the ſons of <hi>Belial,</hi> the mightieſt enemies of God. What is the might of ſinful man, to the mightineſs of God! <hi>The weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God is ſtronger than man;</hi> what then is his mightineſs! We read (<hi>Rev.</hi> 6.15.) how, <hi>the</hi> (Heathen) <hi>Kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief Captains, and</hi> (which may be the recapitulation of all theſe) <hi>the mighty men, hid themſelves in Dens, and ſaid to the Mountains fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that ſitteth upon the Throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb.</hi> The Apoſtle checks the madneſs of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> in ſinning, by an intimation of the mightineſs of God,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:48335:89"/> againſt whom they ſinned (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.22.) <hi>Do we provoke the Lord to jealouſie? Are we ſtronger than he?</hi> As if he had ſaid, What do ye mean? (he ſpeaks to thoſe that would venture to go to the Table of Devils, that is, who cared not how they min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled themſelves, and held Communion, in the things of God, with thoſe who worſhipped Devil-gods, or (as all Idolaters do) Devils rather than God; what mean you (ſaith he to theſe) conſider your ſelves, <hi>Will you provoke the Lord? are you ſtronger than he?</hi> are you his match? are you able to graple with him? not ſo well as a Child with a mighty Giant, or a Lamb with a Lion. The mightineſs of the Lord, his Almightineſs, ſhould make ſinners tremble, and fear to provoke him; he can cruſh them as a Moth, and break them in pieces like a Potters Veſſel. As 'tis the Joy of all true Believers, that God <hi>hath laid help for them</hi> (as 'tis ſaid, Pſal. 89.19.) <hi>upon one that is mighty,</hi> that is, Chriſt, of whom <hi>David</hi> was but a ſhadow; and as 'tis the comfort of the <hi>Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,</hi> (how weak ſoever) that <hi>their Redeemer is mighty</hi> (Prov. 23.11.) So it may fill the faces of the wicked and preſumptuous with confuſion, and their hearts with deſpairing ſorrow, to hear, that God, who is ready to take vengeance on them, is mighty, <hi>Behold, God is mighty;</hi> that's a glorious ſight; and yet behold a ſight more glorious, if more glorious may be,
<q>And deſpiſeth not any.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>What a temperament is here? God is ſo mighty that he feareth none, no, not the mightieſt, yet ſo meek, that <hi>he deſpiſeth not any,</hi> no, not the meaneſt. <hi>Elihu</hi> having aſſerted the mightineſs of God, amplifieth it, Firſt, by his gracious condeſcenſion and moderation in the uſe of his mightineſs; he is mighty, yet he doth not exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe his might in a proud vaunting or contemning way, <hi>he deſpiſeth not any;</hi> that's the firſt thing, in which he amplifies the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God in his mightineſs. Secondly, As God is thus mighty, and moderate in the exerciſe of his might, not <hi>deſpiſing any;</hi> ſo behold another excellency of this might of God, He is mighty, not only in ſtrength of Arm and Authority, but (as the laſt words of the verſe ſet him forth)
<q>In ſtrength and wiſdome;</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or, he is as wiſe as he is ſtrong. Some men have a great deal
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:48335:89"/> of might, and they preſently ſwell proudly, this ſpoyls all; others have a great deal of might, but not a bit of wit, or wiſdome, or underſtanding, how to diſpoſe or make the beſt of it: But what a mighty God have we to do with! who is mighty, and deſpiſeth no man; who hath, not only might of ſtrength, but might of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome too. Thus we ſee how <hi>Elihu,</hi> in this latter part of the verſe, advanceth or extolleth the mightineſs of God, in theſe two things, the infinite Moderation and Wiſdome, that go along with it and act it. I ſhall a little open both. Firſt, his wonderful Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the exerciſe of his mightineſs; <hi>He is mighty,</hi>

                  <p>He doth not deſpiſe man in general, who is the work of his hand; yea, <hi>Job</hi> ſaid once (<hi>Chap.</hi> 14.15.) <hi>Thou wilt have a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to the work of thy hand.</hi> The Lord doth not deſpiſe any of his works, as they are his works, or as they come out of his hand; and therefore when <hi>Jonah</hi> ſeemed to ſet ſo low a rate upon the <hi>Nini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,</hi> who were the work of his hand, his Creatures, the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved him for it, by the Gourd, which when the Lord ſmote, <hi>Jonah</hi> was angry; but ſaid the Lord, <hi>Doſt thou well to be angry for thy Gourd?</hi> Haſt thou mercy upon a Gourd, and ſhould not I ſpare this City, wherein are more than ſix ſcore thouſand perſons, that know not their right hand from their left, and alſo much Cattle? The Lord did not deſpiſe, but pity them.

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:48335:90"/> mean men, becauſe mean; he deſpiſeth not men in proſperity, becauſe they are rich and proſperous, nor doth he deſpiſe men in adverſity, becauſe poor and unproſperous. He deſpiſeth not any upon any of theſe accounts; the Lord deſpiſeth none but the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and the ungodly, the unbeliever and the impenitent, and all them he deſpiſeth, and them he ever will deſpiſe, how great, how high, how mighty, how rich ſoever they are; the Lord deſpiſeth them, and he will alwayes deſpiſe them. He doth not deſpiſe any man becauſe a great man, if he be not a wicked great man; and let men be never ſo poor or low, the Lord looks not diſdainfully upon them becauſe they are ſo; God doth not deſpiſe any man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is in a bad caſe, he only deſpiſeth men, becauſe their caſe or Cauſe is bad, and then he will deſpiſe them, let them be who or what they will. Such is the goodneſs of God, and this good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is his Glory, That although the higheſt and greateſt of men, are but as worms to him, or not ſo much to him as the duſt of the Ballance, or the drop of the Bucket, yet he deſpiſeth not any, no, not the loweſt and leaſt of men.</p>

                  <p>Thirdly, The mighty men of the earth uſually deſpiſe thoſe whom God honoureth moſt. God deſpiſeth not any, but he high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteemeth his own; whereas the mighty men of the World are apt to deſpiſe all, eſpecially his, that is, the Generation of the righteous; they that are neareſt to Gods heart, are fartheſt from theirs. The affections and eſtimations of the mighty, ſeldome fall in with, but run croſs to Gods, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.3.) <hi>He bleſſeth the Covetous, whom God abhors;</hi> that is, he hath a high eſteem of thoſe, whom God cannot abide; and he that doth ſo, will never

O let ſuch mighty ones as deſpiſe theſe, conſider how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like they are to the mighty God, who deſpiſeth not any, who great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honoureth theſe. <hi>Michal, Davids</hi> Wife, <hi>Sauls</hi> Daughter, had a piece of this ſpirit in her; though <hi>David</hi> was a mighty King, ſhe deſpiſed him, only becauſe he was a holy and a zealous King: When ſhe ſaw how he danced before the Ark, when ſhe ſaw how he was taken with the things of God, ſhe deſpiſed him in her heart, and for that was puniſhed with a barren womb, as long as ſhe lived, (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.23.) They who act higheſt in holineſs, are alwayes loweſt in the thoughts of the unholy.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, They that are mighty in Parts and Gifts of ſpeech and knowledge, they who are got a Form higher than their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, how apt are they to deſpiſe all that are below them! Not is this the ſin of carnal vain men only, but of many (for the main) good men alſo, who taking too much notice of their own great Abilities, will ſcarce take any notice of them who have but little. This dead Fly hath corrupted many a Box of precious Ointment; this Weed hath been found growing in the richeſt grounds; and the richer any ground is, the more apt it is to bring forth this Weed, unleſs the Lord, with thoſe other Gifts, give alſo that which is more excellent than all Gifts, even than the Tongue, yea H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:48335:92"/> courage; ſecondly, in wiſdome; and hence we tranſlate diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>He is mighty in ſtrength and wiſdome.</hi> Here are two poynts of Gods might according to our reading: He is mighty, Firſt, in ſtrength; Secondly, in wiſdome. As before we had that Noble combination of Mightineſs &amp; Meekneſs in God, He is mighty and deſpiſeth not any; ſo here we have another noble combination, in his mightineſs, of ſtrength and wiſdome; <hi>He is mighty in ſtrength and in wiſdome.</hi> Some men are mighty in ſtrength, who are weak in wiſdome; others are mighty in wiſdome, but not in ſtrength; bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>h meet and are joyned in God (in whom all things are but one, he being but an infinite ſimplicity, though they are acted diverſly towards man, both theſe (I ſay) meet in God) and he equally excels in both.</p>
                  <p>Yet becauſe, if theſe two be taken diſtinctly, we can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand nothing in God by ſtrength, but what was comprehended in mightineſs before ſpoken of, therefore I conceive, theſe words, <hi>He is mighty in ſtrength and wiſdome,</hi> ſignifie no more in this place than this, That God is mighty in the ſtrength of wiſdome, or that he is mighty ſtrong in wiſdome. And ſo I ſhall proceed with the Text.</p>
                  <p>This ſtrength of the wiſdome of God, or his ſtrong wiſdome, is of two ſorts, or conſiſts in a two-fold wiſdome. Firſt, there is his knowing and diſcerning wiſdome. Secondly, there is his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and diſpoſing wiſdome.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, There is a ſtrength of wiſdome in knowing and diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: God is mighty ſtrong in this wiſdome, in this knowing, this diſcerning wiſdome, (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.3.) <hi>The Lord is a God of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, by him actions are weighed;</hi> He knoweth our actions exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and he will weigh them to a grain, he knoweth our actions to the utmoſt. And as he knoweth our actions, ſo our intentions; he knoweth our inſide as well as our outſide, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 4.13.) <hi>All things are naked and manifeſt before him, with whom we have to do;</hi> and they are not only naked to the skin, but unbowelled, and anatomized to every veine and bone, (<hi>Acts</hi> 15.18.) <hi>Known to God are all his works from the beginning of the world;</hi> he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all his own works, much more ours. Thus God is ſtrong in wiſdome, as wiſdome conſiſts in knowledge; and thus ſtrong he is, he knoweth all things; Firſt, the leaſt things, as well as the greateſt; 'tis no burden, no diſtraction to God, to take notice of
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:48335:93"/> the ſmalleſt matters, even to the numbering of the haires of our head. That's true greatneſs of knowledge, to know the leaſt things and motions of the meaneſt creature. Secondly, he knoweth the moſt ſecret things; <hi>Secret things belong to God, (Deut.</hi> 29.29.) that is, God hath ſecrets which he reſerves to himſelf, man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not know them, man muſt not attempt to know them, ſuch an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt were inſufferable intruſion. Now as God hath ſecrets of his own, which no man muſt meddle with, ſo be medles with all our ſecrets, our ſecrets belong to God as well as his own; he knows the ſecrets of our hearts, he hath a key to that Cabinet, and can unlock it, and look into it; we may lock men, one and other, out of our hearts, but we cannot lock out God, he ſeeth what's there, ſuch is the ſtrength of his knowing wiſdome. Thirdly, He knows things future, or what ſhall be; he knoweth what as yet is not, as clearly as what is; <hi>He declareth the end from the beginning,</hi> (Iſa. 46.10.) Upon this ground the Prophet challengeth all the Idols of the world, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.23.) <hi>Shew the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that ye are Gods;</hi> tell us what ſhall be next, tell us what will be to morrow; that will be a demonſtration of your Divinity; the Lord declareth things to come, and he only declares them. We know little of that which is, he, and he only, knoweth that which will be. All fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures unrevealed, are ſecrets, and among them our thoughts are the greateſt ſecrets, yet them the Lord knoweth, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.2.) <hi>Thou</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) underſtandeſt my thoughts afar off,</hi> that is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I think them; Is not this ſtrength of knowing wiſdome? Fourthly, God knoweth all things alwayes, or everlaſtingly, there is not one of them ſlips out of his knowledge, they are at all times alike, that is, perfectly before him; Is not this alſo ſtrength of knowing wiſdome? Fifthly, The Lord knoweth all theſe things as diſtinctly as if he had but one thing to know. Sixthly, He know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things by one act of ſingle and ſimple intuition, he doth not know (as we) by report from others, nor by comparing one thing with another, nor by inferring one thing from another, that is, he doth not know by diſcourſe, argument, or demonſtration, but all things are before the eye of his knowledge nakedly and immediately, as they are. Theſe two laſt as well as any of, or all the former, are a clear proof, not only, that God is knowing and wiſe, but that he is mighty in ſtrength of knowing wiſdome.</p>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:48335:93"/>
                  <p>Secondly, Conſider wiſdome, as it is applyed in working. Some have much of that wiſdome which we call Theoreticall, knowing, diſcerning wiſdome; but as for practicall, working wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, how to put things together, how to order them as to the buſineſſes and affairs of this life, they are very far to ſeek. We ſay, <hi>Great Scholars are not alwayes the wiſeſt men:</hi> many are knowing, they know almoſt all things, they will diſpute <hi>(de omni ſcibili)</hi> of all things knowable, yet are very weak when they come to lay things together for practice or government; if it be but the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of a family, or of their private eſtate, they know not how to mannage it, much leſs can they mannage the government of great Societies or Corporations, leaſt of all of Kingdomes and Nations. But as for the Lord, he hath not only a knowing wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but a diſpoſing, a governing, a working, practical wiſdome, in ordering all affairs, which we properly call prudence or diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 112.5.) We have ſeen knowing learned men do things very fooliſhly, imprudently, indiſcreetly. But all the works of the Lord are contrived and model'd, as alſo effected and perfected with infinite wiſdome. Hence that Holy exclamation, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.24.) <hi>O Lord, how manifold are thy works, in wiſdome haſt thou made them all?</hi> Which as it is true of all the works of Creation, ſo likewiſe of the works of Providence, the former of which are ſpoken of in the beginning of the Pſalme, and the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the following parts of it. The Lord in wiſdome made the world, <hi>He made the heavens by his wiſdome,</hi> (Pſal. 136.5.) <hi>and by wiſdome hath he founded the earth,</hi> (Pro. 3.19.) If in both thoſe places we underſtand Chriſt by wiſdome, it doth not hinder, but advance this truth; now as the Lord made the world both heaven and earth in wiſdome, ſo in and by the ſame wiſdome he governs heaven and earth, and all his works in both are full of wiſdome. Thus it appears that the Lord is mighty in ſtrength of wiſdome, both as to the knowing and ordering of all things: yea, the Lord is ſo mighty in both theſe kinds of wiſdome, that there is indeed none wiſe but he. And therefore the Scripture not only calls him, <hi>The wiſe God,</hi> but <hi>God only wiſe,</hi> (Rom. 16.27. Jude <hi>v.</hi> 25.) And ſurely he is mighty ſtrong in wiſdome, who hath all the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, or is only wiſe. Some may ſay, How are we to underſtand that? is not wiſdome one of thoſe communicable Attributes of God? ſo we diſtinguiſh the divine Attributes, ſome are commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:48335:94"/> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hers are incommunicable. The infiniteneſs, the omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, the unchangableneſs, the ſimplicity of God are incommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable, but the holineſs, the juſtice, the mercy and wiſdome of God, are communicable; that is, God doth communicate unto man his holineſs, his juſtice and wiſdome. Why then is it ſaid, <hi>That God is only wiſe,</hi> ſeeing God hath endowed many with a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of wiſdome, or hath made many wiſe men in the world?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Firſt, God is ſaid to be only wiſe, becauſe there is none ſo wiſe as he; his wiſdome is ſo much beyond the wiſdome of all men, that no man may be called wiſe but God. Thus alſo God is called <hi>the only Potentate,</hi> (1 Tim. 6.15.) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe though there are many Potentates in the world, yet Gods potency is beyond them all. His life alſo is ſuch, that, at the 16th verſe of the ſame Chapter it is ſaid, <hi>He only hath immortality,</hi> yet both the Angels and the ſouls of men are immortal; but God hath immortality in a way of ſuch eminency, that the very Angels and ſouls of men are mortal in compariſon of him. <hi>David</hi> ſaid of his life, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.5.) <hi>My age is nothing to thee;</hi> I ſcarce live at all, when I conſider the life of God; ſo the wiſeſt man in the world may ſay of his wiſdome, my wiſdome is nothing unto thee, I have no wiſdome when I conſider how wiſe God is.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God is ſaid to be only wiſe, becauſe there are none originally wiſe but he; his wiſdome is of himſelf, yea his wiſdome is himſelf; the wiſdome of God is not a ſeparable quality from him, as the wiſdome of a man is. Many are men, but not wiſe men; but it is impoſſible for God to be God, and not to be wiſe; his wiſdome is eſſential to him. The wiſdome of man is like gild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon an earthen veſſel; but the wiſdome of God is like a gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den veſſel. The wiſeſt men are gilded over with wiſdome, they are adorned and beautified with it, but no man, how wiſe ſoever is wiſdome, only God is. God is (if I may ſo ſpeak) an Immenſe and immeaſurable veſſel of gold, he is all gold, you cannot diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the gold from the veſſel, 'tis gold quite through, he is maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie gold, maſſie wiſdome. The wiſdome of man is another thing from himſelf. The wiſdome of God is himſelf; and thus God alone is wiſe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, God <hi>is only wiſe,</hi> becauſe all wiſdome is from him; as he hath his wiſdome from himſelf, ſo all others have wiſdome from him; all the wiſdome of men and Angels, is but a ray from
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:48335:94"/> his light, but a ſtream, yea, but a drop from his Ocean. <hi>Bezaliel's</hi> Artificial wiſdome was from the Lord, <hi>Solomons</hi> political wiſdome was from the Lord; <hi>Solomon</hi> asked wiſdome from the Lord to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne. And not only is the wiſdome of Princes, Stateſmen and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticians, but the very Plowmans wiſdome is from the Lord, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.26.) where the Prophet having ſhewed how the Plowman tills the ground, how he harrows and caſts in the ſeed, how he threſheth and gets out the graine, he addeth (<hi>v.</hi> 29.) <hi>This comes from the Lord, who is wonderfull in counſel, and excellent in working.</hi> The Plowman knoweth not how to till his ground, to ſow his ſeed, to harrow his land, to threſh his corne, if the Lord did not give him wiſdome for it. Thus common wiſdome as well as political and ſpiritual wiſdome is of God, as <hi>Daniel</hi> confeſſed when the ſecret was revealed to him, (<hi>Dan</hi> 2.21.) <hi>He giveth wiſdome unto the wiſe, and knowledge to them that know underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> Seeing then all wiſdome is from God, we muſt confeſſe, <hi>He is only wiſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The Lord may be ſaid to be only wiſe, becauſe he is victoriouſly wiſe, his wiſdome is a conquering wiſdome, he conquers by his wiſdome as well as by his power; his wiſdome overthrows the wiſe men of the world, (<hi>Prov.</hi> 21.30.) <hi>There is no wiſdome, nor underſtanding, nor counſel againſt the Lord.</hi> Many men will be taking and giving counſel againſt the Lord, but it ſhall not ſtand (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.9.) He is only wiſe, who deſtroyeth the wiſdome of the wiſe, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.19. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.19, 20.) Thus the Lord is <hi>mighty in ſtrength of wiſdome,</hi> in knowing and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing wiſdome, diſcerning all things moſt clearly, and ordering all things moſt wiſely, according to the pleaſure of his holy and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous will: and he is ſo wiſe in all theſe things, that he ought to be acknowledged and reverenced, as <hi>the only wiſe God, or as God only wiſe.</hi> Hence take theſe Inferences.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, If the Lord be mighty in ſtrength of wiſdome as well as in ſtrength of power, <hi>then fear to do any thing amiſs</hi> before him; he will ſpy out every fault; and the more you cover the faults, cracks and flawes in what you do, the more the Lord ſets himſelf to find them out; you cannot hide what you do from him, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take heed what you do.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Is God mighty in ſtrength of wiſdome? <hi>then do not find fault with any thing he doth, for he can do nothing amiſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
                     <pb n="180" facs="tcp:48335:95"/> The works of providence, whether they regard perſons or Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are done with as much exactneſs as the works of Creation were. In what beauty and order was the fabrick of this world ſet up at firſt in ſix dayes! It is called <hi>Coſmos</hi> in Greek, from the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful order viſible quite through it; and certainly, the works of providence are as orderly and perfect as the work of Creation, and ſo will appear at laſt, though now we ſee ſo many appearing confuſions, diſturbances, and toſſings up and down: The Lord keeps order, how diſorderly ſo ever men are. The Lord doth all things in number, weight and meaſure. There is not one, the leaſt, ſlip, error or miſtake in what himſelf doth, not in what he ſuffers men to do as to his own ends, how many errors and miſtakes ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver there are in the wayes of men, or in the means which they uſe. Then take heed of picking holes in Gods work, much more of picking quarrels with his work. We are apt to find fault (where there is none) with what God doth, but how ſlow are we to find faults (where there are many) in our own doings!</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Is the Lord mighty in ſtrength of wiſdome? then never be troubled, though you have mighty wiſe men againſt you; be not afraid, only labour to aſſure the mighty wiſe God for you. If you can but aſſure God, who is mighty in wiſdome for you, you need not be troubled, though mighty wiſe men are againſt you, though <hi>Achitophels,</hi> though <hi>Matchevels,</hi> though the Conclave of <hi>Babylon</hi> be againſt you: if the wiſdome of God be with us and for us, we are well enough, and ſhall do well enough, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the wiſdome of the world againſt us.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, If God be mighty in ſtrength of wiſdome, then, when we want wiſdome, and know not what to do, or how to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, let us go to God; if we want wiſdome to mannage a proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous eſtate, or to bear an afflicted eſtate, let us go to God. The Apoſtle gives this direction (<hi>James</hi> 1.5.) <hi>If any man lack wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> (he ſpeaks of a man in a troublous condition, in a time of temptation) <hi>let him ask of God, who giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not.</hi> God hath wiſdome enough for us, and can make us wiſe enough; apply to him, and you may be ſupplyed for all occaſions.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, If God be mighty in ſtrength of wiſdome, then confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently caſt your care on him, put your all into his hand, (Pſal. 37.5.) <hi>Commit thy way to the Lord, truſt alſo in him, and he ſhall bring
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:48335:95"/> it to paſſe.</hi> (Prov. 16.3.) <hi>Commit thy works unto the Lord, and thy thoughts ſhall be eſtabliſhed;</hi> that is, thy thoughts about thy works, and uſually our thoughts are more unſetled than our works. When we have left a matter in the hand of a wiſe man, how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident are we, and how compoſed are our thoughts, as to the well-iſſuing of it! how much more may we be confident, and compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, when we have believingly left our matters in the hand of the only Wiſe God!</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, If the Lord be ſo mighty in Wiſdome, that he only is Wiſe, then beware of truſting to your own wiſdom, or of being wiſe in your own eyes. That's the counſel of <hi>Solomon</hi> the wiſe, (<hi>Prov.</hi> 3.5.) <hi>Lean not to thy own underſtanding.</hi> We are apt to lean too much to the underſtanding of others; if we have ſuch a wiſe man to counſel us, we think all's ſafe, we are <hi>Cock-ſure</hi> (as we ſay) the work cannot miſcarry. 'Tis dangerous to lean to the underſtanding of others, but much more to lean to our own. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member God is only Wiſe, and we never ſhew our ſelves more fools, than when we lean to our own wiſdome, or think to carry it by our own wit, and ſo depart from the wiſdome of God. Therefore be fools, be nothing in your own wiſdom, and you ſhall be wiſe with the wiſdome of God.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have proſecuted the Text according to our Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:48335:96"/> being mighty himſelf, doth not deſpiſe or reject thoſe that are mighty, becauſe they are ſo; there muſt be ſome other reaſon (it is not their mightineſſe) why God deſpiſes and caſts down the mighty. <hi>God is mighty, and deſpiſeth not the mighty.</hi>

                  <p>Hence Note.</p>
                  <q>The great God is no enemy to greatneſſe.</q>
                  <p>God doth not deſpiſe the mighty, the Kings and Princes of the Earth, as they are ſuch; he hath no antipathy in him againſt greatneſſe, nor doth he reject any man becauſe he is great; if he doth at any time reject a great man, it is becauſe of the abuſe of his greatneſſe: God diſlikes no mans juſt power, but the unjuſt exerciſe of that power. The Authority and Power of man over man is of God, therefore God doth not deſpiſe men becauſe they are in power. He ordaineth Powers, <hi>There is no Power but of God, the Powers that be,</hi>

God cannot deſpiſe his own Ordination. 'Tis the abuſe of Power, and not the Power it ſelf, which the Lord ſets himſelf againſt, and that indeed he doth ſet himſelf againſt; he deſpiſeth the moſt mighty and powerful Princes of the World, when they inſtead of governing, are only vexing others with their Power: This cauſeth him to <hi>poure contempt upon Princes</hi> (Pſal. 107.40.) and renders <hi>him terrible to the Kings of the Earth</hi> (Pſal. 76.12.) Yet the Lord is never ſo angry with, nor doth he ſo aggravate the faults of thoſe that are in Power, as to make Power it ſelf faulty. Indeed, when great and mighty men turn their Power into op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, then the Lord ſpeaks as if he had conceived a diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure againſt all great and mighty men, yet he is not diſpleaſed with their greatneſſe, but with the miſ-improvement of their greatneſſe, and mal-adminiſtration of their Power.

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:48335:96"/> and dryeth up all the Rivers: Baſhan languiſheth, and Carmel, and the Flower of Lebanon languiſheth.</hi> What was the meaning of all this? it only ſignified that the Lord was highly diſpleaſed with the great and mighty Ones of the world, who were to others, as the Sea is to a River, and as <hi>Carmel</hi> and <hi>Lebanon</hi> were to the Plains and low Valleys of the Earth, exceeding them in height and greatneſſe; I ſay, he was highly diſpleaſed with them, becauſe theſe carried it amiſs in the exerciſe of their high Power; it was not becauſe they were high and great, but becauſe they had not exalted God in their highneſſe, nor acted towards man as became thoſe who were advanced above, and over other men. Thus all along the Lord ſpeaks againſt, and rebukes the high and mighty, upon no other account but the unrighteous adminiſtration of their might &amp; highneſs. God quarrels with no man meerly for his might.</p>
                  <p>The Hiſtoryes of all Ages have reported the great and mighty men of the World, oppoſing the mighty, purely becauſe they were ſo. Some ſay they did it out of Reaſon of Statel, but the true Reaſon of it, uſually was their own pride, or envy,<note place="margin">Superbia pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem non fert.</note> becauſe they could not bear thoſe that were equal with them, as <hi>Pompey,</hi> much leſſe a Superiour, as <hi>Caeſar</hi> could not. Or it was out of fear that the great would undermine their greatneſſe, or bring them down. Thus mighty men oppoſe the mighty, as mighty; but the Lord is infinitely above theſe thoughts, <hi>He is mighty, and he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſeth not the mighty,</hi> nor doth he ſet himſelf againſt them,<note place="margin">Magnificus magnificentias cogitabit. <hi>Heb.</hi>

                  <p>Again, Our Tranſlation diſtributes the latter part of the verſe into two Branches of the mightineſſe of God. <hi>He is mighty,</hi> firſt, <hi>in ſtrength;</hi> and ſecondly, <hi>In wiſdome.</hi> This, by others, is rendred a ſingle Propoſition. <hi>He is mighty in ſtrength of heart.</hi> Strength of heart may be taken three wayes: Firſt, For courage in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. Secondly, For patience in troubles. Thirdly, For noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and greatneſſe of mind, in all we do. In this third or laſt ſenſe, we are to underſtand it here; as if <hi>Elihu</hi> had ſaid, <hi>The Reaſon why the Lord being mighty, doth not deſpiſe the mighty, is
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:48335:97"/> this, Becauſe he excels all others, not only in mightineſs and power, but in the nobleneſs of his Spirit.</hi> The Lord hath ſuch an heroical Spirit, that he can do nothing below or unbecoming himſelf. This is an excellent reading of the words. Take two Notes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<q>The Lord hath a wonderful noble heart, and magnificent Spirit.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He hath not only an outward power (as many have) but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward power; he is not only <hi>Maſter of others,</hi> but, as I may ſay, he is <hi>Maſter of himſelf.</hi> Many are Maſters of others, who are not at all Maſters of themſelves; they are mighty in the ſtrength of hand, yet weak as to ſtrength of heart. The inward excellency and mightineſſe of the heart of God, may be ſeen eminently in a threefold reſpect.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The Lord is mighty of heart, as to patience and long-ſufferance, in bearing with thoſe that are evil. The Lord is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely above that patience which conſiſts in the bearing of evil, (though that as was toucht before, ſhews much ſtrength of heart) but he is continually in the exerciſe of that patience, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in bearing with thoſe that are evil. And O how great is the ſtrength and might of Gods heart in this! Some of the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies tranſlate the Original Text,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>long-ſuffering.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Nahum</hi> ſpeaks of God, <hi>as ſlow to anger, and great in power,</hi> (Chap. 1.3.) It argueth ſtrength of heart indeed, when we can ſtop and bridle our boiſterous and angry paſſions, towards thoſe that have offended us. The Lord ſaith unto, or concerning <hi>Pharoah</hi> (Exod. 9.16.) <hi>And in very deed, for this cauſe have I raiſed thee up, for to ſhew in thee my power,</hi> &amp;c. What power? The Lord ſhewed forth a twofold power in the raiſing up of <hi>Pharoah:</hi> Firſt, the power of his Arm, that he was able to caſt down ſuch a mighty Prince. Secondly, The power of his Patience, that he ſpared him from ruin till he had ſent ten meſſages to him, and poured ten Plagues upon him. The Lord was ſo provoked by <hi>Pharoah,</hi> that he might have cruſhed him upon the firſt denyal, but he forbare him long; the Lord might well ſay, <hi>I have ſet thee up that I might ſhew forth my power, my power in forbearing thee long, as well as in deſtroying thee at laſt.</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaks of this power (Rom. 9.22.) <hi>What if
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:48335:97"/> God willing to ſhew his wrath, and make his power known</hi> (the Lord will not only ſhew his wrath hereafter in breaking thoſe veſſels of deſtruction, but he ſhews his power now in ſuffering them long, and therefore he to make his power known) <hi>endured with much long-ſuffering the Veſſels of wrath fitted to deſtruction.</hi> Here's the ſtrength of the Lords heart, he bears long with wicked men.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is a mighty power or ſtrength of heart in God, as in long-ſuffering towards impenitent ſinners, ſo in pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſinners who repent. Who,<note place="margin">Magni animi eſt ignoſcere.</note> but the Lord hath ſuch a ſtrength of Spirit, to pardon and paſſe by offences! After the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had mutined, and murmured,<note place="margin">Sola ſublimis et excelſa vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus eſt, nec quicquam mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, niſi quod ſimul placi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum. <hi>Sen.</hi>
                     </note> and ſo provoked the Lord to the height, <hi>Moſes</hi> begs and beſpeaks the power of the Lords pardoning-mercy, (<hi>Numb.</hi> 14.17.) <hi>And now I beſeech thee let the power of my Lord be great, according as thou haſt ſpoken, ſaying, The Lord is long-ſuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity,</hi> &amp;c. As if <hi>Moſes</hi> had ſaid, <hi>Lord, thou muſt put forth as much power in pardoning the ſins of this People, as ever thou didſt in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering them from their bondage-ſufferings in Egypt.</hi> Or thus, <hi>O Lord, thou mighteſt magnifie the power of thine anger in puniſhing this rebellious People, but rather magnifie the power of thy patience and long-ſufferance in ſparing and pardoning them.</hi> O what ſtrength of heart is in God, who paſſeth by the great tranſgreſſions of his People!</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Lord hath a mightineſſe of heart in executing his wrath upon his incorrigible enemies, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.11.) <hi>Who knoweth the power of thine anger?</hi> The anger of God is ſuch a thing as no man can go to the bottome of it in his thoughts. The Lords wrath is powerful, beyond all imagination and apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; his anger, as well as his love, paſſeth knowledge. In all theſe reſpects the Lord hath ſtrength of heart, or he is mighty in ſtrength of heart, as well as in hand or arm. The greateſt diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of Gods power, are in the wayes of his mercy. His Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are called his ſtrange work, but his mercy is his ſtrength, as the Prophet calls it, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.5.) where warning <hi>the Bryars and Thorns</hi> to take heed of warring with God, he gives a ſinner this counſel, <hi>Let him take hold of my ſtrength, that he may make peace with me, and he ſhall make peace with me.</hi> But what is meant by the ſtrength of God?

'Tis our weakneſſe not to paſſe by wrongs and injuries done to us. To bear wrongs is to be like the high and mighty God, to bear them in mind, is to be like the loweſt and weakeſt ſpirited men. He is ſtrong indeed, who is ſtrong in patience againſt Offenders, and as ſtrong in mercy to pardon humble ones, as in power to puniſh ſtubborn and rebellious ones.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, By way of Illation,</p>
                  <p>Note.</p>
                  <q>'Tis the greatneſs of Gods Spirit, or the ſtrength of his heart and mind, which moderates him towards ſinful man.</q>
                  <p>That which keeps men in a moderate frame towards men, is true greatneſſe of ſpirit: They that are of ſuch a ſpirit, will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſpiſe thoſe that are below them, nor envy thoſe that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove them, not willingly oppoſe thoſe that are equal to them. The envy and oppoſition of others greatneſſe, ariſeth from the meanneſſe and weakneſſe of our own ſpirits. The reaſon why one man is affraid that another ſhould be high, is becauſe himſelf hath not a real highneſſe of ſpirit; or the reaſon why moſt oppoſe the greatneſſe of others, is the littleneſſe of their own ſpirits. Whence ſpring contentions and ſtrifes, envyings at, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minings of one another? come they not from the narrowneſſe of our hearts, that we cannot rejoyce in the good of others, or from the impotent jealouſies of our hearts, that we fear others will do us hurt? If ſuch a one get up, he will pull me down; if ſuch a one be high, 'tis dangerous to me, therefore I muſt pull him down, if I can; whence comes this, but from lowneſſe and poorneſſe of ſpirit, from that pitiful thing in man, called <hi>Puſillanimity.</hi> The Lord hath ſo great a Spirit, that as he envieth no mans greatneſſe,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:48335:98"/> ſo he feareth no mans greatneſs, and therefore doth that which is juſt and equal to all ſorts of men, bad and good, as is further ſhewed in the next verſe.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, God doth not ſhew any favour to, nor indulge wicked men in their evil wayes. He that will not ſo much as p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>he giveth right to the poor.</hi> Theſe Texts are of the ſame ſence, and expound each other. From the former part of this ſixth verſe already opened, <hi>he preſerveth not the life of the wicked,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerve, Firſt;
<q>Wicked men are out of Gods Protection, they can expect no favour from him;</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>They are out-lawed. Some perſons are out-lawed by men, and then if any man injure them, or kill them, they can have no remedy by the Law; they have their amends (as we ſay) in their own hands, the Law gives them none. Wicked men are out of Gods love, and therefore out of his care; he turns them up (as we ſay) to the wide World to ſhift for themſelves: whether they ſink or ſwim, 'tis all one to him. He is neither Sun nor Shield to the wicked, he is both to the godly, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.11.) <hi>The Lord is a Sun and a Shield, the Lord will give Grace and Glory; no good thing will he with-hold from them that walk uprightly.</hi> As a Sun he giveth out the warm Beams of his ſavour, to refreſh and revive them, when the World leaves them cold and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortleſs: And as a Shield he defends and ſaves them, when the World ſtrikes at them and vexes them; he will keep them ſafe from evil, as with a Shield. The wicked have no ſhare in this, not in any ſuch-like promiſe; the Lord is rather Fire and Sword, than Sun or Shield to them; he neither comforts them while they live, nor preſerves their lives from death.</p>
                  <p>But ſome may ſay, Doth not God preſerve the lives of the wicked? Is it not ſaid (<hi>Job</hi> 7.20.) <hi>He is the preſerver of men?</hi> Which indefinite ſeems to carry it for all men: And (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.6.) <hi>Thou preſerveſt man and beaſt.</hi> Yea, wicked men not only live, but proſper and flouriſh in the World, as <hi>Job</hi> complained, (<hi>Chap.</hi> 21.7.) <hi>Wherefore do the wicked live, bec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I anſwer, Firſt, It cannot be denyed, but that the wicked hold their lives, and all the good things they have (poſſibly they have many good things) of God. But the wicked, and their live<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ovidence of God, which extends even to the Beaſts of the field; they are not preſerved by any ſpecial Providence or Promiſe of preſervation made to them: their <hi>Souls are not bound in the bundle of life with the Lord their God,</hi> as <hi>Abigail</hi> aſſured <hi>David</hi> his ſhould be (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.29.) nor are they, as one very well expreſſeth it in the Language of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> (Chap. 4.3.) <hi>written</hi> (or reckoned) <hi>among the living in Jeruſalem.</hi> Neither their life, nor their death, is precious in the Lords ſight, as both of the meaneſt Saints are (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.15.) The ſpecial Promiſes of preſervation are made to the godly; the common Providences of preſervation extend to the wicked. God preſerves many wicked men, but not one of them can plead a Promiſe for his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, or ſay, Lord, thou haſt undertaken to preſerve me, I have thy Word or Warrant for my preſervation. So then, the Lord doth not preſerve the life of any wicked man upon a word of Promiſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I anſwer, When the lives of the wicked are preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they are not preſerved for any love which God bears to their perſons as ſuch, but either, Firſt, to bring them into a better ſtate, that is, to turn them from their wickedneſs, that being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, they may be ſaved at laſt, according to his purpoſe: Or, Secondly, they are preſerved, to ſerve ſome ends and purpoſes of his in this World. For though God hath no pleaſure in them, yet he makes ſome uſe of them, and doth his pleaſure by them; Or, I may ſay, they are preſerved to be Executioners of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, in chaſtening and correcting his own people. The King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> was preſerved in great Power; and to what end? <hi>I will ſend him againſt an hypocritical Nation,</hi> (Iſa. 10.6.) He muſt go on my Errand, though <hi>he meaneth not ſo, nor doth his heart think ſo,</hi> (as the Lord ſpake, verſ. 7.) He hath other matters and deſigns in his head, but I have this uſe of him, and of his power, even to puniſh <hi>the people of my wrath.</hi> The Lord made uſe alſo of <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezar,</hi> and his Army, to ſerve him in the deſtroying of <hi>Tyrus,</hi> and of him and his Army he ſaith, <hi>They wrought for me,</hi> (Ezek. 29.20.) Thus the Lord doth ſome of his work, his ſtrange work eſpecially, his work of Judgment, by the hands of wicked men; and therefore he preſerves their lives. Yea, he preſerves them many a time to be a help and a defence to his people.
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:48335:100"/> A Thorn Hedge keeps the Paſture, that ſtrange Cattle break not in, and eat it up. Wicked men are as Bryars and Thorns, and they are ſuffered to live, becauſe the Lord can make uſe of them as a Fence to his people. When <hi>the Serpent caſt out of his mouth water as a Flood after the woman</hi> (the Church) <hi>that he might cauſe her to be carryed away of the Flood,</hi> then <hi>the Earth</hi> (that is, earthly, carnal men) <hi>helped the Woman</hi> (Rev. 12.15, 16,) The Lord uſed bad men to do that good work, the preſervation of his diſtreſſed and perſecuted Church.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, As the Lord ſuffers many wicked men to live, that they may be brought out of their ſins, ſo he ſuffers others to live that they may fill up the meaſure of their ſins. Why did the Lord preſerve the <hi>Amorites?</hi> was it becauſe he loved or liked them? no, but becauſe they were not then ripe for Judgment, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 15.16.) <hi>The Iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.</hi> Some wicked men are to fill up their dayes, that they may fill up the meaſure of their Fathers ſins, by their own, as Chriſt threatned the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> (Math. 23.32.) Such a grant of life, though for a thouſand years, is worſe than a thouſand Deaths.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, we may anſwer, The wicked are not ſo much preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from, as reſerved unto further wrath, (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9.) <hi>The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the unjuſt unto the day of Judgment, to be puniſhed.</hi> God doth not preſently puniſh all the wicked, nor take away their lives; there is a day of Judgment coming, and till that day come, their lives are preſerved, as perſons reſerved unto Judgment.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, VVhen wicked men are ſaid to be out of the Lords Protection, conſider, There is a twofold Protection; Firſt, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary; Secondly, extraordinary. The Lord doth preſerve and protect wicked men in an ordinary, not in an extraordinary way; he doth not work wonders, much leſs miracles, to preſerve them, as he often doth for the preſervation of his own people. God will not be at ſuch coſt in preſerving of wicked men, as he is at in the preſerving the lives and liberties of his eminent Servants; rather than they ſhall periſh, or not be preſerved, he will ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times work a miracle, and put Nature out of its courſe, to ſave their lives. VVhen thoſe three VVorthies were caſt into the midſt of the burning fiery Furnace, God ſtopt the rage of that furious Element, that <hi>the Fire had no power upon their bodyes, nor
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:48335:101"/> was an hair of their head ſinged, neither were their Coats changed, nor the ſmel of fire had paſſed on them,</hi> (Dan. 3.27.) Did we ever hear that the Lord reſtrained the power of the fire, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve wicked men? When <hi>Daniel,</hi> a man precious in the ſight of God, was caſt into the Lions Den, the Lord preſerved his life al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, by ſtopping the Mouths of the Lyons, (<hi>Dan.</hi> 6.22.) Did we ever hear that God preſerved the lives of wicked men in ſuch a way? No ſooner were <hi>Daniels</hi> accuſers caſt into the Lyons Den, but the Lyons had the Maſtery of them, and brake all their bones in pieces, e're ever they came to the bottome of the Den, (<hi>v.</hi> 24.) The Lord doth not preſerve the lives of the wicked, by miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous manifeſtations of his Power and Glory.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, I anſwer, Though ſome wicked men are commonly preſerved, as other men, yet many by their wickedneſs, haſten their ruine, and ſhorten the number of their dayes. We may diſtinguiſh of wicked men; Firſt, wicked men may be taken in a General notion, for all that are unconverted, and unregenerate. Many perſons paſs for honeſt and good men in the world, who yet are wicked, being carnal, and abiding in a ſtate of nature: wicked men of this ſort, are ordinarily preſerved. Secondly, Take wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men (and ſuch I conceive the Text eſpecially intends) for notorious wicked men, ſuch as are murderers, blaſphemers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Lord doth not preſerve the lives of ſuch, but lets mans Juſtice ſeize upon them, or divine vengeance overtake them (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.23.) <hi>The blood-thirſty and deceitful man ſhall not live out half his dayes;</hi> that is, he ſhall not live half ſo long as he might, according to the courſe of Nature, becauſe of his nefarious ſinful courſes. Hiſtories are full of dreadful Tragedies, ſealing to this Truth, with the blood and untimely death of groſs offenders. How of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten have we ſeen or heard of the Ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>eſe we are eſpecially to underſtand the Poynt and Text, <hi>He preſerveth not the life of the wicked.</hi> Take this Inference from all that hath been ſaid about this awakening Obſervation,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>How ſad is the life of a wicked man!</hi> indeed of any man on this ſide the Line of grace, but eſpecially of any very wicked man! He can ſcarce be ſaid to live, whoſe life is not preferved by God; a wicked man is alwayes in death, ſeeing God doth not preſerve his life. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid he was <hi>in Deaths often,</hi>
                     <pb n="193" facs="tcp:48335:101"/> but God had as often preſerved his life; but they are in Deaths alwayes, whoſe life God never preſerveth. VVhat preſervation of life can he have, who hath not God for his preſerver? God in Creation or Propagation giveth us our life as to being; but Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation gives us our life as to well-being. Can it be well with them that are not under the preſervation of God? To be redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Chriſt would be but a ſmall comfort, unleſs we were alſo preſerved by him. (<hi>Jude</hi> 1.) <hi>To them that are ſanctified by God the Father, and preſerved in Jeſus Chriſt, and called.</hi> If we were only redeemed from death, and not preſerved in life, what were our ſpiritual life to us? So I may ſay in reſpect of the life of the body; to be meerly created or propagated, what is it, if we are not preſerved? 'Tis a high Priviledge, when a man can, not only ſay, he hath received life from God, but his life is preſerved by God. That's the firſt poynt. <hi>He preſerveth not the Life of the wicked.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, From that other Interpretation of the words, as not to preſerve is as much as to deſtroy and ruine,</p>
                  <p>Note,
<q>As God utterly diſowneth, ſo he will at laſt utterly ruine all wicked men.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He not only doth not favour them, but <hi>pours out fury upon them,</hi> (Jer. 10.25.) <hi>Pour out thy fury upon the Heathen that know thee not, and upon the Families that call not on thy Name.</hi> The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaks no better concerning them than that prayer of <hi>Jeremy. (Iſa.</hi> 3.11.) <hi>Wo unto the wicked, it ſhall be ill with him, for the reward of his hand ſhall be given him.</hi> And what can the hand of a wicked man earn? the wages of ſin is death; he can get nothing but wrath, and death, nothing but tribulation and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh here, and eternal miſery hereafter, by the work of his hands. VVoe to the wicked, for the reward of his hands ſhall be given him, that is, eternal deſtruction and ſorrow ſhall be given him, according to the iniquity of his hand. A godly man is rewarded according to the cleanneſs of his hands (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.20, 24.) He labours to keep his hands, (much more his heart clean, whatever the VVorld judge of him) But woe to the wicked when God giveth them the reward of their hands, of their unclean, ſoul and filthy hands; for what can ſuch hands get or procure by all their
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:48335:102"/> labour but their own miſchief and ſorrow? <hi>There is no peace, ſaith my God, to the wicked,</hi> (Iſa. 57.21.) No peace is to them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no good is done by them: their portion lyes in promiſes, who keep Commandements, ſo theirs muſt needs lye in threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, who do nothing but break them, or break them in all they do. <hi>My meditation of him ſhall be ſweet, I will be glad in the Lord,</hi> (ſaid <hi>David,</hi> P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Conſider theſe words, <hi>He preſerveth not the life of the wicked,</hi> with reſpect to the wicked, ſpecially intended and treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of in this Context, <hi>The Lord is mighty, and deſpiſeth not the mighty</hi> (becauſe they are mighty) <hi>he preſerveth not the wicked.</hi>

<q>Wicked men, how mighty ſoever, cannot preſerve themſelves, nor doth the Lord undertake for their preſervation.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſtrongeſt of wicked men, cannot ſtand by their own ſtrength, they cannot protect nor preſerve themſelves, and the Lord will not put forth his ſtrength to preſerve them from falling. As no mightineſs, no power can bear man up, or maintain him againſt the Lord, ſo not without the Lord; if he preſerveth not the life of the wicked, they cannot eſcape death and deſtruction, though high as Cedars, and ſtrong as Oakes. They cannot but periſh, whom God preſerveth not. <hi>He preſerveth not the life of the wicked,</hi>

                     </note> and gives them <hi>right,</hi> or rights them, and that in a twofold notion. Firſt, He gives them that right which is due to them, according to his own righteous Laws, or the righteous Laws of men. That's right done, which is done according to a righteous Law. Secondly, He giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them that right which is due to them according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of their own hearts and wayes. We may ſay, Thirdly, The Lord giveth them right, not according to the ſtrictneſſe of the Law, but according to the integrity of their hearts. Thus <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> prayed (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 7.3.) <hi>Judge me, O Lord, according to my righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and according to mine integrity that is in me;</hi> that is, according to my honeſt meaning, and the ſimplicity of my Soul. As if he had ſaid, <hi>O Lord, do me right; men have done me wrong, they have falſe and wrong apprehenſions of me, they raiſe falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports concerning me, but thou, O Lord, who knoweſt my integrity wilt judge me accordingly, and 'tis my humble and earneſt Prayer that thou wouldeſt. He giveth right</hi>
                     <q>To the poor.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The poor in Scripture are taken two wayes; Firſt, as they ſtand in oppoſition to the rich; Secondly, as they are oppoſed to the proud; thus here, he giveth right to the poor, as well as to the rich; and he will eſpecially give right to the humble poor, to the righteous poor, to the poor in ſpirit. Such the Prophet ſpeaks of (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.2.) <hi>To this man will I look, even to him that is poor.</hi> He means not the poor in purſe (as ſuch) he means not thoſe (as ſuch) who wear poor cloaths, the Lord doth not always look to, or reſpect ſuch poor, for many ſuch are both proud and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but he looks to him that is poor in ſpirit, or of a <hi>contrite ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;</hi>
                     <pb n="196" facs="tcp:48335:103"/> let ſuch be in Rags, and lye upon the Dunghil, the Lord will look to them; and he hath a threefold look for them. Firſt, A look of honour, as reſpecting their Perſons. Secondly, A look of care, to ſupply their wants. Thirdly, A look of juſtice, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them from wrong. And if they that are poor in ſpirit, be rich alſo in the world, they ſhall not fail to receive right from the hand of the Lord. The Lord giveth right to all ſorts of men againſt their wicked oppreſſors; but his poor, the Godly poor, believing poor, thoſe that are poor not only in purſe, but in ſpirit, are more peculiarly under this priviledge, of being righted by the Lord. And uſually in Scripture, the word <hi>poor</hi> is taken in a good ſence,<note place="margin">Nomen paupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris in bonum ſumitur, paupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res ſunt popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus Dei.</note> for good men, as the word <hi>rich,</hi> in an ill ſence, for evil men (<hi>Jam.</hi> 5.1.) <hi>Go to now ye rich men, weep and howl for the miſeries that ſhall come upon you.</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaks as if that were the caſe of all rich, or as if he called all rich men to weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and howling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet ſome poor men are wicked, and ſome rich men are righteous; and therefore I conceive the word <hi>poor</hi> may be taken here for any wronged or oppreſſed poor, yet eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for the Godly poor. For though God giveth right to all men, even the worſt of men, yet here the ſcope of <hi>Elihu</hi> is to ſhew that God takes moſt care of thoſe whom the wicked do moſt, not only neglect, but injure and oppreſſe, <hi>He giveth right to the poor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Note;
<q>
                        <p>The poor, eſpecially the Godly poor, are often wronged, and go by the worſt in the world. Or thus:</p>
                        <p>The poor, as poor, uſually ſuffer from, and by the world.</p>
                     </q>

                  <p>As the world is apt to oppreſſe any poor, ſo moſtly the Godly poor, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 12.5.) <hi>For the oppreſſion of the poor I will ariſe.</hi> 'Tis poſſible a rich man may be oppreſſed, a mighty man may be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by one mightier than he; but uſually the poor are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and they trampled on, who are already underfoot. And therefore the Lord ſaith, <hi>For the oppreſſion of the poor, for the ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the needy, now will I ariſe, and ſet him at ſafety from him that puffeth at him.</hi> This is not excluſive, the Lord will ariſe for the help of the rich and great, when any ſuch are wronged; but he is ſaid to ariſe for the help of the poor, as intimating that the poor ſeldome come by their right, or find help in the world, unleſſe
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:48335:103"/> God ariſe to help them, or help them to it; and becauſe he hath ſaid he will help them to their right, we may be ſure he will. <hi>Davids</hi> Faith was ſtrong upon this promiſe, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.27.) <hi>Thou wilt ſave the afflicted people,</hi> (Pſal. 72.4.) <hi>He ſhall judge the poor of the People.</hi> (P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Lord careth ſo for the poor, as if he cared for none elſe; and the beſt of the poor are little cared for by any, but the Lord. (<hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.12.) <hi>I will alſo leave in the midſt of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they ſhall truſt in the Name of the Lord.</hi> The rich of this world truſt to creature helps, but as the Lords poor know they ought not to truſt in creature help, ſo they have it not to truſt to, and therefore they truſt in the Name of the Lord, not only out of choice (which is their grace and duty) but out of neceſſity. And what will the Lord do for them that truſt in him, not only out of neceſſity but choice? he will ſurely take care of them, and do them right.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Note;
<q>God rights the poor freely.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He giveth them right, he doth not ſell it. What freer than gift? They need not bribe for it. As he freely giveth them the Righteouſneſſe of his Son to juſtifie them, ſo they have common right of free gift to relieve them.</p>
                  <p>Note Thirdly;
<q>The Lord relieves, or rights the poor ſpeedily.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He giveth,</hi> implyeth a preſent act, and that doubles the mercy.</p>
                  <p>Note Fourthly;
<q>God will always right the wronged poor.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He giveth,</hi> imports even a continued act; as he did it in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, in the dayes of old, ſo he doth it at this day, and will do it always. As the Lord giveth right ſpeedily, ſo conſtantly, with him is no variableneſſe or ſhadow of turning. Moſt men do
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:48335:104"/> right only by fits, but the Lord is ever giving right.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>He giveth right to the poor,</hi> not to this, or that poor man, but to the poor.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note;
<q>The Lord diſtributes right to all that are wronged.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As his Mercy, ſo his Juſtice is not confined to a few, but flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out to all.</p>
                  <p>But it may be objected, <hi>Why then are ſo many poor without their right? If the Lord giveth right, and giveth it continually, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially, why do the poor cry, and ſigh, and groan, and mourn? why ſee we ſo many tears of the poor? If they have right, why do they complain?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The Lord giveth right to the poor, ſometimes, when the poor perceive it not. (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 97.2.) <hi>Clouds and darkneſſe are round about him, Righteouſneſſe and Judgement are the habitation of his Throne.</hi> When a man cannot ſee the Lord doing right, yet the Lord doth right. The Sun ſhineth when eclipſed or covered with a Cloud. The Lord never ceaſeth to right the poor, though neither poor nor rich perceive how, or which way he doth it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I anſwer, He giveth right to the poor, even when they want right, or when they are under the ſoreſt oppreſſions, by ſupporting their hearts in this perſwaſion, that he will give them right. The poor have right when their minds are ſatisfied that they ſhall have right. There is no true Godly poor man in the world, how much ſoever afflicted, but his heart is, or may be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that he ſhall have right. That's a ſure word (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.18.) <hi>The needy ſhall not always be forgotten, the expectation of the poor ſhall not periſh for ever.</hi> And therefore we may pray with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, <hi>Forget not, O Lord, the Congregation of thy poor for ever,</hi> (Pſal. 74.19.) The poor may reſt in this aſſurance, while their troubles reſt upon them, that God will <hi>bring forth their Righteouſneſſe as the Light, and their Judgement as the Noon day,</hi> (Pſal. 37.6.) He hath right, who believes he ſhall have it; as he that believeth, hath everlaſting life in hope, long before he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the poſſeſſion of it, (<hi>John</hi> 3.36.)</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Though we ſay, The Lord giveth right to the poor, both ſpeedily and conſtantly, yet he reſerveth to himſelf a liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:48335:104"/> as to time, and means, and manner; as in all his outward Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations, ſo in miniſtring or giving out this right; the Lord waits to be gracious, till we are ready for his grace, and he waits (in the ſame ſence) to be righteous, till the poor are ready for their right; they ſhall not ſtay for it, when once they are ready for it; and it would be a wrong to them to have their right, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are ready for it.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, There is a day ſpoken of, wherein the Lord will do all his poor right in the view of all the world, (<hi>Acts</hi> 17.31.) <hi>He hath appointed a day in the which he will judge the World in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, by that man whom he hath ordained.</hi> The day approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, wherein the Lord will judge the world in righteouſneſs. Right is prepared &amp; deſigned for them. The time till right ſhall be done to all, as is deſired, or to the utmoſt of their deſires, maketh haſt: <hi>He that ſhall come, will come, and will not tarry; Behold</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I come quickly, and my reward is with me, to give every man accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as his works ſhall be,</hi> (Rev. 22.12.) And if the Lord come with a reward in his hand for thoſe who have done well, he will undoubtedly come with right in his hand to give all thoſe who have ſuffered wrongfully.</p>

It is indeed high treaſon againſt the King of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to clip his coyn, his word, which bears the royal ſtamp and ſuperſcription of his truth and holineſs.

                     </note> or his providence. And we may take notice, that in Scripture, where this expreſſion is uſed without any further addition, it is alwayes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in a good ſenſe. When we read either of Gods keeping his eyes upon his people, or of his not withdrawing his eyes from his people, it alwayes reſpects their priviledge, benefit and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; <hi>He withdraweth not his eyes</hi>
                     <q>From the righteous.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He doth not ſay, from this or that righteous man, but from <hi>the righteous,</hi> implying the whole kind or generation of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous. The indefinite is univerſal; we may render it thus; he withdraweth not his eyes from any that are righteous. The righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous here may be taken in a two-fold notion, Firſt, for the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, as to their ſtate, or who are in a ſtate of righteouſneſs. Man wanting a righteouſneſs of his own, hath the righteouſneſs of another aſſigned and imputed to him. Juſtified perſons through faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, are righteous perſons, as hath been ſhewed heretofore. Secondly, We may take <hi>righteous</hi> here, with reſpect to the righteouſneſs of their wayes and actions: <hi>They who do righteouſneſs are righteous,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>John.</hi> To a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtate, there belongs a righteous way, a righteous walk, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous acting; not that the righteous do not ſin, but they would not, nor do they ſin at all as the unrighteous. It is a high blemiſh or ſtaine to the Goſpel, when any that pretend to a righteous ſtate, or to righteouſneſs by Jeſus Chriſt, are not righteous as to their
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:48335:106"/> wayes and courſe, as to their walkings and workings, whether to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God or man. 'Tis true, in a ſtrict legal ſenſe, none are righteous, no not one; but in a Goſpel ſenſe all juſtified and fanctified perſons are righteous; and they are called ſo, not only poſitively as to what themſelves are, but comparatively, as to what the men of the world are, who live in a ſtate or walk in a courſe of ſin and unrighteouſneſs. <hi>The Lord withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſome may here object or queſtion, Is this true only of the righteous? Doth the Lord at any time withdraw his eyes from the unrighteous? truly that would be very good newes to many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous perſons, they would be glad that they and their way might be hid from God, or that God would not look upon them.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, This Scripture is not to be ſo underſtood, as if God did behold the righteous and not the wicked, for (<hi>Prov.</hi> 15.3.) <hi>The eyes of the Lord are every where, beholding the evil and the good,</hi> whether things done or perſons doing them. The Lord doth not withdraw his eyes from the moſt unrighteous perſons, nor from any of their acts or wayes of unrighteouſneſs. And when it is ſaid here, <hi>The Lord withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous,</hi> it is meant of a peculiar eye, which the Lord hath upon the righteous; he beholds both the righteous and the unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, yet he doth not behold the unrighteous, as he beholds the righteous; which I ſhall clear further by giving in a five-fold diſcovery, what that eye of the Lord is which is upon the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, foure of which are diſtinct and totally differing from that eye with which he beholdeth unrighteous men, and from every one of them I ſhall give you an obſervation for our further profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by this general aſſertion, that <hi>the Lord withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous.</hi> There is a five-fold eye of God ſpoken of in Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, There is a diſcerning eye, that eye by which be uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly knoweth what every man is, and what every man doth.</p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>The Lord taketh exact and full notice of, he clearly diſcerns the righteous in every condition.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is true alſo of the unrighteous; therefore <hi>David</hi> puts it
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:48335:106"/> univerſally, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 11.4.) <hi>His eyes behold, his eye-lids try the children of men,</hi> that is, his ſight diſcovers and diſcerns what they are, of what ſort ſoever they are. We may ſee many men, yet not diſcover what they are, they may have a faire outſide to our view, whileſt within they are foule and full of rottenneſs; they may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in Sheeps cloathing, yet inwardly be ravening Wolves. But the Lords eye is a trying eye, he doth not only know who men are, but he knows what they are. Such is the importance of that Scripture, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 4.13.) <hi>All things are naked and manifeſt to his eyes, with whom we have to do;</hi> that is, the Lord doth ſo behold things and perſons, that he hath a clear underſtanding of them. And though the Lords eye be thus upon all men, yet this is ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially affirmed of righteous men, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.18.) <hi>Behold, the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him, and hope in his mercy.</hi> Again, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.15.) <hi>His eye is over the righteous.</hi> Both texts teach us, that God conſiders not only <hi>what they do,</hi> but as I may ſay, <hi>how they do,</hi> whether it be peace with them, or whether it be trouble with them, whether it be joy with them, or whether it be ſorrow with them, the Lords eye is over them, to diſcern, not only whether, and how they go, but how things go with them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Lord hath a directing or a counſelling eye.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note;
<q>The Lord with his eye favourably guides, directs, and counſels righteous men.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This eye of the Lord, as it denotes favour, is peculiar to the righteous. We have that expreſly, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.8.) <hi>I will inſtruct thee, and teach thee,</hi> (how?) <hi>I will guide thee with mine eye.</hi> We put in the Margen, <hi>I will counſel thee,</hi> that is, thee a Godly man, a <hi>David,</hi> ſpoken of (<hi>v.</hi> 6, 7.) mine eye ſhall give thee counſel. Men can give direction by the eye, and they that are acquainted with them, underſtand what they mean when they look this way or that way, thus or ſo. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>A naughty perſon winketh with his eyes, he ſpeaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers, (Pro.</hi> 6.12, 13.) that is, all the poſtures and geſtures of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſhew what he is, ſtark naught, and ſilently teach others to be naught. The holy God alſo teacheth by his feet and fingers, his goings and doings, his workes and wayes teach us the work which we ſhould do, and the way wherein we ſhould go; he hath a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:48335:107"/> eye; the looks of providence give counſel to thoſe who know how to look upon them, and interpret them. The Lord hath a providential eye upon the righteous, not only to foreſee their dangers, but to direct their courſe; he ſheweth them their way, and their work by this eye; he tells them what pleaſeth him, and what diſpleaſeth him, by this eye; this eye the Lord doth not withdraw from the righteous; <hi>He will guide the feet of his Saints,</hi> (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.9.) 'Tis poſſible for a righteous man ſometime to be without counſel, he may neither know what counſel to give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, nor what to take from others; as <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> ſaid in his ſtreight (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.12.) <hi>He knoweth not what to do;</hi> yet (as <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> ſaid then) <hi>his eyes are towards the Lord,</hi> and the Lords eyes are towards him. When he is thus counſelleſs, there is a counſelling, a directing eye of God upon him; though he at that preſent know not his way, yea, be out of his way, yet he is not out of Gods eye, and that will in due time ſhew him his way, or bring him into his way again: though God ſuffer him to go out of the way, yet the eye of God is upon him, even when he is out of his way, and that eye will reduce and bring him back to his right way. There is a directing, a counſelling eye of God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Scripture ſpeaks of a pitying and a compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating eye of God. It is ordinary with us to hear thoſe that are in diſtreſs cry out to thoſe who paſs by, <hi>caſt an eye upon us, look upon us,</hi> and that is as much as to ſay, pity us, have compaſſion upon us; this eye of pity the Lord doth not withdraw from the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.</p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>The righteous are under the compaſſionating, the pitying eye of God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were in <hi>Egypt,</hi> the Lord ſaid to <hi>Moſes,</hi> (Exod. 3.7.) <hi>I have ſurely ſeen the affliction of my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi> and what kind of ſight was that? what eye of God was it which was upon them? the words following, and the whole ſeries of Gods dealings alſo clear it, that it was an eye of compaſſion; <hi>I have ſurely ſeen,</hi> or <hi>ſeeing I have ſeen the affliction of my people that are in Egypt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and I am come down to deliver them.</hi> We read in that notable place, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 16.14.) when <hi>Hagar</hi> was in a very ſad and diſtreſſed condition, being caſt out of <hi>Abrahams</hi>
                     <pb n="205" facs="tcp:48335:107"/> family, God had compaſſion on her, and ſhewed her a Well, where ſhe might have water for her ſelf and child, and the text ſaith, <hi>She called the name of the Well Beer-la-hai-roi,</hi> that is, <hi>the Well of him that liveth and ſeeth me:</hi> As if ſhe had ſaid, <hi>God hath ſeen me in my afflicted condition, and he hath alſo had compaſſion on me.</hi> That's another great priviledge, the righteous are under this pitying and compaſſionating eye of God; and from thence follows,</p>
                  <p>The fourth eye of God, <hi>his providing eye, his caring eye.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>The Lord doth ſo eye the righteous in their ſtraits and afflictions with compaſſion, that he alſo provides to deliver them out of their affliction, out of their ſtraits.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a providing eye of God continually beholding his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; Of this providing eye <hi>Abraham</hi> ſpake, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 22.14.) when he was put upon that hard task, the ſacrificing of his own ſon, his <hi>Iſaac,</hi> the Lord had compaſſion on him, and provided another ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and therefore he called the name of that place, <hi>Jehovah Jireh, the Lord will ſee or provide;</hi> that is, as the Lord hath ſeen and provided for me, ſo he will ſee and provide for all his in their greateſt exigents and extremities. What <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid, all the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> may ſay in the day of their diſtreſs, <hi>Jehovah Jireh, the Lord will ſee and provide.</hi> And as the Lord hath a ſeeing and a providing eye for his in times of diſtreſs, ſo at all times. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid of the Land of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> (Deut. 11.12.) <hi>It is a Land of hills and of vallies, a Land which the Lord thy God careth for: The eyes of the Lord thy God are alwayes upon it, from the beginning of the year, even unto the end of the year.</hi> The eyes of the Lord are upon the land, that is, upon the people of the land, or upon the land for the peoples ſake who dwell in it: What to do? the text anſwers, <hi>to care for it,</hi> that is, to provide all things for their good, to give raine in ſeaſon, and the fruits of the earth, not only for the ſupport, but comfort of his people. We read of the ſame eye promiſed to the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Land of their captivity, (<hi>Jer.</hi> 29.6.) <hi>I will ſet mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them again into this Land;</hi> I will not only give them a look, or a glance, but fix or <hi>ſet mine eyes upon them for good,</hi> that is, to do them good. It is a proverbial ſaying amongſt us, <hi>The Maſters eye fattens the Horſe:</hi> The Maſters eye is a caring, a providing eye,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:48335:108"/> he will take care that the Horſe ſhall be well fed. Certainly, Gods eye is a ſattening eye; they ſhall be fat and flouriſh, from whom God will not withdraw his providing eye, at leaſt they ſhall have neceſſaries, or food convenient, both for ſoul and body.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, The Scripture ſpeaks of a delighting eye, or of an eye of complacency; and thus alſo the Lords eye is upon the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, he beholdeth them with high content, he is, as I may ſay, taken with them, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.1.) <hi>To him will I look that is poor.</hi> Among all objects, none ſo pleaſant or pleaſing to God as the poor. What poor doth he mean? ſurely the righteous poor, or the poor in ſpirit, (as was ſhewed upon the former verſe) let ſuch a one be whom he will, <hi>to him will I look,</hi> mine eye is greatly pleaſed to behold ſuch a one. The word uſed by <hi>Elihu</hi> in this Text, doth further clear it, while he ſaith, <hi>He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous.</hi> How pleaſant is any object to our eyes from which we cannot withdraw or take them off, but muſt be continually feeding them upon it! Some cannot take off their eyes from unlawfull wanton objects, becauſe they are ſo delighted in them, they have as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>eyes full of adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,</hi> and ſuch can never glut their eyes with adulterous objects. Now certainly the Lord is exceedingly taken with the beauty, the ſpiritual beauty of a righteous perſon, with the comlineſs, the ſpiritu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ll comlineſs of thoſe that are godly, when the Text ſaith, <hi>He withdraweth not his eyes from them,</hi> but carries them (as it were) alwayes in his eye. Among the Latines, to carry one in our eye is an expreſſion of ſingular high content, delight and pleaſure taken in ſuch a perſon. We may ſay of all the righteous, the Lord carrieth them in his eye, and therefore he is highly pleaſed and delighted with them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">In oculù oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quem geſtare, eſt eum vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menter ample<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti &amp; diligere.</note>Thus you have this five-fold eye, which the Lord doth <hi>not withdraw from the righteous;</hi> and, in that the text ſaith, he doth not withdraw or abate or diminiſh his eye from them, but looks fully upon them, it gives us this fixth note;
<q>The inſpection of God upon, his compaſſion towards, his care of, his delight in the righteous is perpetual.</q>

The Lord ſaith of the Church, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.16.) <hi>Thy walls are continually before me.</hi> As the walls of <hi>Sion,</hi> ſo the walls of every righteous perſon in <hi>Zion,</hi> or of every true Sioniſt, are continually before the Lord, <hi>he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draweth not his eyes from the righteous; He that keepeth Iſrael ſhall neither ſlumber nor ſleep,</hi> (Pſal. 121.4.) he that neither ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers nor ſleeps, needs not withdraw his eyes from us, and he that hath a tender regard to us, will not. The Prophet (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.3.) ſpeaking of the Church under the Allegory of a Vineyard, brings in the Lord giving this aſſurance, <hi>I will water it every moment, I will keep it night and day.</hi> He that waters a Vineyard every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, never withdraws his eyes from it; now by watering is meant the ſupply of whatſoever good the Vineyard or Church of God ſtood in need of; to be ſo ſupplyed is to be well watered.

                     </gap> meaning of that Scripture, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.23.) and of ſeveral others of like importance; <hi>Awake Lord, why ſleepeſt thou?</hi> That was at once the voyce of the Church, and her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint; ſurely the Lords eyes were withdrawn from the Church when he was aſleep. I anſwer, The Lord ſleeps, with reſpect to his Church, as the Church ſleeps with reſpect to the Lord, (<hi>Cant.</hi> 5.2.) <hi>I ſleep</hi> (ſaith the Spouſe) <hi>but my heart waketh.</hi> Indeed the Lord doth act ſometimes ſo towards the righteous, or lets things go ſo with the righteous, as if he were aſleep, as if he took no notice of them, yet ſtill his heart waketh towards them: So that his ſleeping doth not imply an intermiſſion of his care, but only a ſuſpenſion of the effects of his care. For while the Lord lets things go ſo as if he were aſleep, he then wakes and watches as much over the righteous, over his Church and people, as at any other time, when they have the higheſt actings of his providence for their outward peace and preſervation.</p>

I anſwer, Thoſe Scriptures are all of them to be underſtood according to the former interpretation, the Lord hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf, as to ſenſe and preſent appearance, but he never hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf, as to the real continuance of his love and care towards his Church or People. This Objection ſome made to one of the Ancients; the Lord (ſaid they) may ſeem to withdraw his eyes from the righteous, becauſe he ſuffers them to fall under the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the unrighteous.<note place="margin">Famulos ſuos nunc m gis, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicit, nam jam praevidet, quid eis miſerecor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diter recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet. <hi>Greg: in loc:</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Conſider therefore, you that are in a righteous ſtate, whoſe acts and words, and walkings, are alſo righteous, conſider your Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, conſider what it is to have the Lord Jeſus alwayes ſetting his eye upon you, to have the Lords directing and counſelling eye alwayes upon you, to have the Lords pitying and compaſſionating eye alwayes upon you, to have the Lords providing and caring eye alwayes upon you, to have the Lords delighting and well-pleaſed eye alwayes upon you; to have the eyes of the Lord thus upon you, and to have them alwayes upon you, what can ye deſire more! Thus 'tis promiſed, (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.9.) <hi>The eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to ſhew himſelf ſtrong in the behalf of them, whoſe heart is perfect with him.</hi> And whoſe hearts are perfect with him, but the hearts of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous? this is their priviledge. Jeſus Chriſt (<hi>Zech.</hi> 3.9.) is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>The ſtone,</hi> and ſaith the Text, <hi>upon one ſtone ſhall be ſeven eyes.</hi> There are two interpretations given of that Propheſie, Firſt, thus, <hi>upon one ſtone ſhall be ſeven eyes,</hi> that is, the eyes of all men ſhall be upon that ſtone, upon Chriſt. Seven is a perfect definite Number, put for all numbers; the eyes of all ſhall be upon the ſtone, upon Chriſt; although he be to the wicked, or to them <hi>that believe not, a ſtumbling ſtone, and a rock of offence,</hi> (1 Pet. 2.8.) yet to them that believe he is a moſt precious ſtone; and as they are alwayes beholding the beauty of that precious ſtone, ſo Jeſus Chriſt doth indeed invite all eyes to behold him (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.1.) <hi>Behold me, behold me;</hi> he would have us take off our eyes from all others, and look ſteddily on him. Let all eyes be upon the ſtone; that's a good interpretation. There is a ſecond, which ſuits the preſent poynt I am upon fully; <hi>Seven eyes ſhall be upon one ſtone;</hi> that is, the eyes of God ſhall be upon Jeſus Chriſt. This is a promiſe made unto him as Mediator, when he came in the fleſh, or in our nature, to do that great work for us; <hi>Then,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>upon one ſtone ſhall be ſeven eyes;</hi> which ſeven eyes note the perfect knowledge of God, and ſo the perfect care that God would have of Chri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="210" facs="tcp:48335:110"/> are enlightened by Jeſus Chriſt; ſo the eyes of God, the eyes of the Father were alwayes upon him, in favour, in love, in care, when he was here in this world about that great work of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and he had abundunt experience of the eyes of his Father upon him. Now, mark it, this was the great promiſe made to <hi>Chriſt, the Stone,</hi> that upon him <hi>ſhould be ſeven eyes,</hi> the eyes of the Lord ſhould be alway and fully upon him. And this is the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of every one that hath part and intereſt in this ſtone Jeſus Chriſt, every righteous perſon hath <hi>ſeven eyes</hi> upon him, the Lord God beholds him exactly, perfectly, and alwayes; <hi>He withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not his eyes from the righteous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A ſecond inference is this; If the Lord never withdraweth his eyes from the righteous, <hi>Then let the righteous know their duty:</hi> What's that? <hi>Never to withdraw their eyes from the Lord.</hi> There is a threefold eye which a righteous man ſhould never withdraw from God. Firſt, An eye of faith: Secondly, An eye of hope: Thirdly, An eye of dependance: and that, Firſt, for direction in all his wayes; Secondly, for protection in all his dangers. <hi>I will lift up mine eyes</hi> (ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 121.1.) <hi>unto the hills, from whence cometh my help.</hi> And again, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 123.1, 2.) <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwelleſt in the heavens. Behold, as the eyes of ſervants look unto the hand of their Maſters, and as the eyes of a mayden unto the hand of her Miſtreſs, ſo our eyes waite up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lord our God, untill he have mercy on us;</hi> that is, we never withdraw our eyes from him, while we have need of his mercy, and that is alwayes. <hi>Walk before me,</hi> that is, with an eye of faith, hope, and dependance, was the Lords charge to the father of the faithfull, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1.) <hi>I have ſet the Lord alwayes before me,</hi> that is, I keep a conſtant eye upon the Lord, was the profeſſion of <hi>David,</hi> as the type of Chriſt, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.8.) And as to keep an eye on God is beſt and ſafeſt for us, ſo 'tis extreamly pleaſing and contentfull to Chriſt, as he tells the Church, (<hi>Cant.</hi> 9.9.) <hi>Thou haſt raviſhed my heart, my Siſter, my Spouſe, thou haſh raviſhed my heart with one of thine eyes,</hi> that is, with a believing, a hoping, a depending look on me for all that good which thou wanteſt and wouldſt have, or with a delighting look on me as thy chiefeſt good. Let not the righteous withdraw their eyes from God, <hi>for he withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe words fully clear up the ſenſe, which I have given of that negative promiſe, <hi>he withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous,</hi> namely, that the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous for good. His is not a bare beholding of them, favours flow from his eyes. When <hi>the eyes of God are upon the righteous,</hi> they find the ſweet and benefit of it. In the former verſe <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaid, God will give the poor right, here he ſaith more, he will give the poor, the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous poor, a reward, and that no ſmall one, <hi>With Kings are they on the Throne.</hi>

                  <p>Whom he highly eſteems, he ſometimes advanceth highly in this world, they ſhall be with Kings on the Throne, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.40, 41.) <hi>He powreth contempt upon Printes,</hi> that is, upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous Princes; yet (as it followeth) <hi>He ſetteth the poor on high from affliction,</hi> ſo we tranſlate and put in the Margen, <hi>He ſetteth the poor on high after affliction.</hi> He afflicts the righteous to purge them, and ſo to prepare and fit them for greateſt enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. We have a like affi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>mation, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 113.7, 8.) <hi>He raiſeth up the poor out of the duſt, and lifteth up the needy out of the dunghill, that he may ſet them with Princes, even the Princes of his people.</hi> Thus ſpake <hi>Hannah</hi> in her Song, (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.8.) and thus, in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, ſpake the bleſſed Virgin in hers, (<hi>Luke</hi> 1.52.) <hi>He hath brought down the mighty from their ſeats, and hath exalted the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and meek.</hi> We have ſome Scripture-inſtances of ſuch exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <hi>Joſeph,</hi> a righteous perſon, was caſt into bonds, yet God ſets him, not only at liberty, but on high, he was with the King on the Throne, <hi>Only in the Throne,</hi> (ſaid <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> Gen. 42.40.) <hi>will I be greater than thou;</hi> and all were commanded to bow the knee to him. <hi>David,</hi> a righteous perſon, followed the Ewes great with young, and the Lord ſet him upon the Throne, upon the Throne of <hi>Iſrael. Valentinian</hi> was committed to priſon by the command of <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate, becauſe he ſtruck an Idolatrous Prieſt, that would have ſprinkled him <hi>(aqua luſtrali)</hi> with their unholy holy water, as he ſtood in the gate of the Temple, where <hi>Julian</hi> was ſacrificing to his Idol-gods; yet he eſcaped that danger, and afterwards aſcended the Throne of that Great Empire. The Lord knows both how to deliver the righteous out of trouble, and to bring them to honour.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, We may hence infer, <hi>If the righteous are with Kings on the Throne, then righteouſneſs hath a reward. Them that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour me</hi> (ſaith the Lord, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.30.) <hi>I will honour.</hi> It is no vaine thing to ſerve the Lord; to be righteous, and to do righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:48335:112"/> cannot but iſſue well. The Lord hath all promotions at his diſpoſe, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 75.6, 7.) And therefore he ſaith, <hi>Say ye to the righteous, that it ſhall be well with him; for they ſhall eate the fruit of their doings,</hi> (Iſa. 3.10.) <hi>With Kings are they on the Throne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet, let me add, by way of Caution, that neither this Text, nor the notes given from it, are ſo to be underſtood, as if all righteous perſons might hence expect great advancements in this world, or to be the ſpecial Favourites of Kings and Princes: The word of God doth not feed ſuch humours, but mortifies them; nor doth it cheriſh any ſuch aſpiring expectations in righteous men, but teaches them quiet ſubmiſſion in their own private ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and callings, to thoſe who are upon the Throne. So that while <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith of the righteous, <hi>With Kings are they on the Throne,</hi> his meaning muſt be taken ſoberly, and may be taken di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly, thus;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That God hath great reſpect to, and high favours for righteous men.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That he brings ſome of them (as it is ſaid of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> with the Prince of the Eunuches, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.9.) <hi>into favour and tender love with Kings and Princes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That the Lord hath often advanced righteous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to Thrones and Kingly Dignities. And when-ever the Lord advanceth any of the righteous,<note place="margin">Etiamſi id ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternè non fiat ſemper, tamen omnium fides &amp; pietas quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rundam piorum exaltatione ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noratur. <hi>Coc.</hi>
                     </note> he makes good this promiſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the exaltation of one, the faith and piety of all righteous perſons, or the whole kind of them, is honoured and exalted.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, To be ſure, all the righteous ſhall be with Kings on the Throne hereafter. Chriſt hath purchaſed, and is gone to prepare a Kingdome for the righteous, and will give them a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Crown, than any this world affords, an incorruptible one. As now the righteous are ſpiritual Kings, or Kings in a ſpiritual ſenſe, (<hi>Rev.</hi> 1.6.) that is, they rule over and keep in ſubjection, their own luſts and corruptions, pride, ambition, love of the world, wrath, envy, and whatever elſe in them doth rebell and exalt it ſelf againſt the knowledge of God; yea, they as Kings (in this world) conquer the world by faith, (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.4.) and the Prince of this world, the devil, through the power of Jeſus Chriſt (as I ſay all the righteous are now ſpiritual Kings (in the ſenſe given) through grace here on earth, ſo they ſhall be glorious Kings and reigne with Chriſt for ever in Heaven; and then ſhall this word
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:48335:112"/> of God by <hi>Elihu,</hi> be fulfilled to the utmoſt, <hi>With Kings are they upon the Throne,</hi>
                     <q>Yea, he doth eſtabliſh them for ever, and they are exalted.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Elihu</hi> proceeds to ſhew the happineſs of the righteous yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; The Lord doth not only advance them, but eſtabliſh them; nor doth he only eſtabliſh them for a while, but even perpetua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth their eſtabliſhment, <hi>He eſtabliſheth them for ever.</hi>

Thus in the text, <hi>He will eſtabliſh them for ever,</hi> that is, they ſhall have long eſtabliſhment.

                  <p>Hence Note;

                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, He eſtabliſheth all things, whether they be, Firſt, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things, the heavens and the earth, times and ſeaſons, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 8.22.) or Secondly, Civil things, States and Nations; or Thirdly, Spiritual things; Firſt, the Goſpel, and the Church of the Goſpel, that he eſtabliſheth as a Rock, againſt which the gates of hell ſhall not prevaile, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 16.18. ſo <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.28. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 87.5.) Secondly, Grace in the hearts of his people, (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.10.) and them in the wayes of grace, (2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.3.) Thus God eſtabliſheth all things.</p>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:48335:113"/>
                  <p>Secondly, He eſtabliſheth, counſels and actions, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.26.) <hi>He confirmeth the word of his ſervants, and performeth the counſel of his Meſſengers;</hi> that is, he makes good, and brings to effect that word which they have given in counſel. And as for actions, <hi>Moſes</hi> prayeth (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.17.) <hi>Eſtabliſh thou the work of our hands upon us, yea the work of our hands eſtabliſh thou it.</hi> Whatever is in our hands quickly molders away, and (as the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies ſaid when the <hi>Jewes</hi> built the walls of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Neh. 4.3.) <hi>If a Fox go up upon it, it will fall, unleſs the Lord eſtabliſh it;</hi> but neither the Foxes with their ſubtilty, nor the Lyons with their power and cruelty, ſhall be able to overthrow that wall, or thoſe actions, which the Lord is pleaſed to eſtabliſh; for <hi>he doth eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh them</hi>
                     <q>For ever.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Note;
<q>The Lord can eſtabliſh, not only for a time, but for alwayes; he can give a perpetuity of eſtabliſhment, not only a laſting, but an everlaſting eſtabliſhment; he can give an eternity of eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here is compleat happineſs. What can we deſire more, than Firſt, to be in a great and good eſtate; Secondly, to be eſtabliſhed there; Thirdly, to be eſtabliſhed for ever? They that are ſet high are ſet in ſlippery places, unleſs the Lord be with them; how much more if the Lord be againſt them? (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.18.) But the Lord can ſet us as high as the higheſt Rock, and yet make us as firme as the firmeſt Rock. <hi>He doth eſtabliſh them for ever,</hi>
                     <q>And they are exalted.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some read thus, <hi>He eſtabliſheth them for ever, when they are exalted,</hi> which makes a very clear ſenſe; when they are got high, the Lord doth eſtabliſh them fully and finally. We render it as a diſtinct act of God, <hi>They are eſtabliſhed for ever, and they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted;</hi> probably intending thus much; that the Lord when he will do a thing, can do it, notwithſtanding all oppoſition, that either is or can be made againſt it; he ſets them with Kings on the Throne, and doth eſtabliſh them for ever, yea, they riſe in power and dignity more and more, <hi>They are exalted.</hi>

<q>What God will do, ſhall be done;</q>

                  <p>If he ſaith to a perſon, be exalted, he ſhall be exalted; if he ſaith to <hi>Jeruſalem, thou ſhalt be built, and to the Temple, thy founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall be laid,</hi> (Iſa. 44.28.) it is done; if he ſaith, pull down <hi>Babylon,</hi> down it muſt come, even to the very foundation. <hi>Ephraim</hi> ſaid, (<hi>Jer.</hi> 30.18.) <hi>Thou haſt chaſtiſed me, and I was chaſtiſed;</hi> I found the effects of thy chaſtiſement, it came home to me.

                  <p>He doth eſtabliſh them for ever, when they are exalted. God is able to maintain his own acts, whether in caſting any down, or exalting them. When God laid <hi>the mountains and heritage of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau waſt for the Dragons of the Wilderneſs,</hi> (Mal. 1.3.) <hi>Edom</hi> ſaid at the next verſe, (well, I ſee) <hi>we are impoveriſhed, but we will return, and build the deſolate places.</hi> As if <hi>Edom</hi> had ſaid, Though the Lord hath brought us thus low, yet we doubt not to recover our former glory. But what ſaith the Lord? hear what in the next line; <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, They ſhall build,</hi> (or let them build) <hi>but I will throw down.</hi> Now (I ſay) as when the Lord pulls down, none can build without his leave, ſo whom the Lord exalteth, none can pull down; <hi>He eſtabliſheth them for ever, when they are exalted.</hi> Thus <hi>Elihu</hi> ſets forth the exceeding kindneſs of God to, and his care over the righteous, not only his provident care as to their preſent condition, but as to the abiding of their exaltation and the eſtabliſhment of it for ever.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, That the procuring cauſe of theſe afflictions, is their own ſin; for we find mention of their tranſgreſſion in the 9th verſe, and of their iniquity in the tenth.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That the purpoſe and deſigne of God towards them, when they have brought themſelves into ſtreights, &amp; are caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an afflicted condition, is very gracious, and tends to their ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting good. And this deſigne is three-fold.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To diſcover their ſin to them; that's laid down at the 9<hi rend="sup">t</hi>h verſe, <hi>Then he ſheweth them their work, and their tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, To prepare them for a better receiving of faithful counſel and inſtruction, at the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, <hi>He openeth alſo their ear to diſcipline.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, To bring them quite off from their ſin; that's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the cloſe of the 10th verſe, <hi>and commandeth that they return from iniquity.</hi> Theſe are the parts, this the purpoſe of the Context under hand;
<q>
                        <bibl>
                           <hi>Verſ. 8.</hi>
                        </bibl> And if they be bound in fetters.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is ſome queſtion who are to be underſtood as the Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to this, <hi>they, if they,</hi> who are they? Some, becauſe the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:48335:114"/> words following ſpeak of <hi>tranſgreſſion</hi> and <hi>iniquity,</hi> conceive, that ſurely it muſt be meant of wicked men, or of the ungodly; but <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l hu</hi> comes not upon that ſubject til the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe; there he turns his ſpeech to ſuch, <hi>but the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore here he doth not ſpeak of, or to, wicked, but righteous men, falling into trouble and affliction; <hi>they,</hi> that is, <hi>the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Again, Taking righteous men to be the Antecedent (as the text plainly carries it) yet there is a difference in opinion, whether we are to underſtand <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeaking of righteous men in that ſpecial dignity deſcribed at the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, ſuch as are <hi>with Kings on the Throne,</hi> or of righteous men in general: I conceive we may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the text of either. And therefore,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, When <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith, <hi>If they be bound in fetters,</hi> he may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend thoſe righteous men who were ſo highly exalted in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer verſe, ſuch a change may come upon them; even they who were <hi>with Kings on the Throne,</hi> may come to be <hi>bound in fetters, and holden in the cords of affliction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, He may intend it of righteous men in any other condition; for <hi>Elihu</hi> having ſhewed how graciouſly God dealeth in exalting ſome righteous men, ſheweth that God is gracious al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo unto thoſe that are not exalted, even unto thoſe that are great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly afflicted, and brought very low. Briefly, as in the former verſe he ſpake of righteous men lifted up, ſo here of righteous men caſt down: As if he had ſaid, <hi>If any of the righteous are at any time ſo far from being exalted with Kings on the Throne, that they are caſt upon the dunghill, and are brought into great ſtreights, yet it is not becauſe God takes no care of them, or becauſe he hath caſt them out of his favour; but it is thus with righteous men for many bleſſed ends and purpoſes, which God hath upon them, or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, to ſhew them their ſin, to fit them for inſtruction, and to bring them off from their iniquity.</hi> Thus the words prevent an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; for <hi>Elihu</hi> having ſaid, <hi>he withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous, but with Kings are they on the Throne,</hi> ſome might ſay, You can ſhew us very few ſuch ſights, you can ſhew us few righteous men with Kings on the Throne, or exalted highly in this world; and we can ſhew you many righteous men in great trouble, in fetters and cords of affliction. Well, ſaith <hi>Elihu,</hi> ſuppoſe it be ſo, ſuppoſe you find many righteous men in ſuch a low condition,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:48335:115"/> yet God withdraweth not his eyes from them, no not then; yea, he is doing them good by all the evils that they ſuffer. So then, if this relative <hi>they</hi> referre to righteous men in either capacity, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſuch as were before exalted, and are now affl cted, or to ſuch righteous men as were never ſo exalted, yea as are depreſſed and caſt into an afflicted condition, yet God withd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <q>If they be bound in fetters, and holden by the cords of affliction.</q>
                  <p>Here are two hard words, <hi>bound and holden,</hi> bound as captives, bound as priſoners, <hi>bound</hi> in fetters, yea, and <hi>holden in cords, holden</hi> or <hi>caught</hi> as a poor bird in a net or ſnare, or as a wild beaſt in a toyle. <hi>Bound in fetters, and holden in cords.</hi> Theſe <hi>fetters</hi> and <hi>cords</hi> may be underſtood two wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Literally and properly, it is poſſible for a righteous man to be bound in fetters, and holden in cords, plainly ſo called. <hi>Joſeph</hi> was caſt into priſon, <hi>and the Iron entred into his ſoul,</hi> and his feet were hurt in the Stocks, in material Stocks.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We may expound theſe <hi>fetters and cords</hi> figurative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or metaphorically, and ſo any trouble or ſtreight is as a fetter, and as a cord: Thus to be <hi>bound in fetters,</hi> and <hi>holden in cords,</hi> is but an expreſſion ſignifying any afflicted condition. Fetters and cords are Emblems of ſlavery &amp; captivity. The P ophet foreſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the willing contribution of divers ſtrange Nations towards the help of the <hi>Jewes</hi> in their return from the Babyloniſh captivity, as alſo, beyond that, their ſubjection to Chriſt and the power of the Goſpel, gives it under this ſhadow, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.14.) <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, the labour of Egypt, and merchand ſe of Ethiopia, and of the Sabeans, men of ſtature ſhall come over unto thee, and they ſhall be thine,</hi> (that is, they ſhall yeild themſelves to thee as thy ſubjects, and more) <hi>they ſhall come after thee in chaines, they ſhall come o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;</hi> that is, they ſhall follow thee as captives do a conquering enemy, in chaines. In what chaines? the meaning is not, that they fhall come with chain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

We read in the holy Hiſtory of the Kings, that the ſervants of <hi>Benhadad</hi> came with ropes about their

                     </gap>opes and chains, is, in Scripture Language, to come in deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt humiliation; and <hi>to be bound in chaines and fetters,</hi> is to be in greateſt affliction. That's the ſenſe of the Prophet (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.22.) <hi>Now therefore be ye not mockers</hi> (there were ſome that derided him, threatning judgement in the name of the Lord, take heed of that) <hi>leſt your bands be made ſtrong;</hi> that is, leſt God bring you into ſuch great afflictions, that you ſhall find and feel your ſelves (as it were) in bands, or (as <hi>Elihu</hi> expreſſeth it in the Text) <hi>bound in fetters, and holden in the cords of affliction.</hi> So then, this notes in general any ſtate of trouble or ſorrow, of miſery or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity that befalls us here below, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.10.) <hi>They that ſit in darkneſs, and in the ſhadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron;</hi> that is, as faſt bound in affliction, as if they were bound in iron.

<q>The beſt of men may fall into the worſt outward condition;</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>They may be in a condition of captivity, they may be in reall fetters and cords, or they may be in a ſtate of affliction, as bad to them as fetters and cords. I have heretofore, more than once, ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the afflictions of the righteous in the opening of this Book, therefo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e I ſhall not ſtay upon it here. Only take notice that the righteous may come into fetters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not only for tryall of their graces, but for the puniſhment of their iniquities; they poſſibly have not kept cloſe to the bands of duty, and therefore God brings them into the bands of calamity. As wicked men ſay in the pride and ſtoutneſs of their hearts, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.3.) <hi>Come, let us break their bands, and caſt their cords from us;</hi> that is, thoſe bands of duty and cords of obedience which the Goſpel layeth upon them; So,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:48335:116"/> in a degree, good men, righteous men, may throw off the cords of obedience, and the bands of duty, through the violence of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and temptation, walking looſely &amp; vainly for a ſeaſon, they may break the bands of the Goſpel Covenant, and the cords of the Commandement, and when they do ſo, God will not ſpare them, but will throw them even into the bands of trouble and into the cords of affliction; they ſhall know the fetters and bands of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, threatned in the Law, when they have not carefully kept to the rule of the Law.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Taking the righteous in that ſpecial capacity, for ſuch as were once exalted, and in high place, or as 'tis ſaid in the former verſe, <hi>With Kings on the Throne,</hi> and finding them here in fetters and bands, Note,
<q>The worldly ſtate of good, of righteous men, as well as others, is ſubject to change.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>For though that text ſaith, <hi>He eſtabliſheth them,</hi> yet it is not to be underſtood that God doth ſo eſtabliſh righteous men in their places, that they can never be put out of them, or ſo exalt them, that they ſhall never be pulled down; that text ſheweth what God can do, he can exalt them ſo, that they ſhall not be removed for ever, and he often exalts them ſo, but he doth not ſo alwayes; for the outward eſtates of good men may have as great changes, as the outward eſtate of wicked men have: they may come from thrones to priſons, and from chaines of gold to fetters of Iron. There have been many ſuch changes as to the things of the world, even to thoſe that are not of the world; And as Heathen Princes and Kings have often found ſuch changes, ſo alſo did ſeveral of the Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> they were brought from the throne to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. <hi>Zedekiah</hi> and <hi>Jeckoniah</hi> and <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> had ſuch ſad changes; when they highly provoked God, they came from their Thrones to the priſon, from a Crown to the cords of affliction; yea this hath been the lot of many other righteous men exalted, they have been brought to the priſon, and laid very low in this world. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith of one, (<hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 4.14.) <hi>Out of priſon he cometh to reigne,</hi> and of another he ſaith in the ſame verſe, <hi>He alſo that is borne in his Kingdome becometh poor;</hi> ſuch viciſſitudes and revolutions come over the heads of the children of men, yea good men are not exempted from ſuch changes and revolutions. Therefore be
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:48335:116"/> not offended if at any time you ſee good men in chaines and fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, in a condition of great affliction.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, From the manner of expreſſion, <hi>When they are bound in fetters, and holden in cords.</hi> Affliction is ſet forth and deſcribed by <hi>cords</hi> and <hi>fetters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>Afflictions are grievous to the fleſh.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Are not fetters ſo? are not cords ſo? The word here tranſlated <hi>cords,</hi> is ſeveral times in Scripture applyed to ſignifie the pains of a woman in travel; thoſe are moſt dolorous paines; ſuch are ſome afflictions. The Apoſtle ſpeaking of affliction in generall, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 12.11.) ſaith, <hi>No chaſtning for the preſent ſeemeth to be joyous, but grievous.</hi> 'Tis no eaſie thing to be in fetters and cords, to be bound in chaines. Afflictions ſtreighten, and preſs, pinch &amp; gall like fetters, they burthen the fleſh, they are no light mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Though the Apoſtle, comparatively to the weight of glory, calleth the heavieſt outward afflictions <hi>light,</hi> (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17.) yet firſt, in themſelves; and ſecondly, to our fleſh, they are very heavy. Therfore we ſhould pity thoſe that are in affliction, as thoſe that are in fetters and cords, and we ſhould pray for thoſe that are in affliction, as for thoſe that are bound. Every affliction is a kind of captivity: <hi>If they be bound in fetters, and holden in cords of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction;</hi> thus it may be with the righteous. But is not this an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that God hates them? ſurely no; we read the mind of God towards them notwithſtanding this in the next verſe.</p>
                  <q>
                     <bibl>
                        <hi>Verſ. 9.</hi>
                     </bibl> Then he ſheweth them their work;</q>
                  <p>That is, when they are in cords and fetters. But did he never ſhew them their work before? yes, doubtleſs he did; but then eſpecially and effectually, then he ſheweth, he declareth, he makes manifeſt to them, or he cauſeth them to ſee and know their work. The word in that conjugation ſignifieth, not barely to <hi>ſhew,</hi> but to make them <hi>ſee, underſtand</hi> and <hi>conſider</hi> their work; he brings them to a review of what they have done, and to ſee that they have done amiſs. <hi>Then he ſheweth;</hi> it is a ſhewing with power, an <hi>efficacious ſhewing, he ſheweth them their work.</hi> What work? this their work may be conſidered two wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, As to the matter of it, what they had done. Till we ſee
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:48335:117"/> what we have done, we repent not of what we have done, how much ſoever it ought to be repented of; as the Lord complained of <hi>Iſrael</hi> by the Prophet (<hi>Jer.</hi> 8.6.) <hi>No man repented of his wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, As to the vitiouſneſſe or falſeneſſe of it, <hi>He ſheweth them their work,</hi> that is, either what they had done which was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil in the matter of it, or what they had done in an evil manner, though in it ſelf good; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he ſheweth them the evil of their work, the irregularity, the crookedneſſe, and ſinfulneſſe of their work. That this is the meaning, appeareth plainly in the words that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, <hi>Then he ſheweth them their work, and their tranſgreſſion;</hi> that is, that there is ſome tranſg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eſſion or fault, poſſibly many faults and tranſgreſſions, in their work. <hi>Then he ſheweth them their work.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Note,

                  </p>
                  <p>That is, of the fleſh in man (<hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19.) <hi>The works of the fleſh are manifeſt, which are theſe, Adultery,</hi> &amp;c. Good is Gods work in us, evil is our work againſt the mind of God. Sin is often cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the work of our hands, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 28.4.) <hi>Give them after the work of their hands, render to them their deſert;</hi> that is, what they have deſerved by their ſins. <hi>Moſes</hi> declared his fear and holy jealouſie concerning the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in this Language, (<hi>Deut.</hi> 31.29.) <hi>I know that after my departure, ye will utterly corrupt your ſelves, becauſe ye will do evil in the ſight of the Lord, to provoke him to anger by the work of your hands.</hi> Idolatry is ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called the work of mans hands, becauſe Idolaters either wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip that as a god, or God by that, which their hands have wrought (<hi>Rev.</hi> 9.20.) <hi>They repented not of the works of their hands, that they ſhould not worſhip Devils, and Idols of Gold, and Silver, and Braſſe,</hi> &amp;c. Yet Idolatry is much more the work of the heart, than of the hand. And as Idolatry, ſo any other ſin, whether of heart or tongue, may be called the work of our hand, it being that which is moſt properly our work, though originally the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils work. As to pardon ſin, is properly the work of God, ſo to commit ſin, is properly the work of man. There is no work ſo much ours, as that; no work properly ours, but bad work; all the good we do, is the work of God in us, or by us.</p>
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:48335:117"/>
                  <p>Secondly, Note;
<q>Man doth not ſee the falſeneſs and faultineſs of his own work, till God ſheweth it him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There may be many cracks and flaws in our good works, which we perceive not, we are ready to think and ſay, <hi>All's well,</hi> we have done very well, until God lets us ſee our work in his light, in the light of his Word and Spirit; and then we ſhall ſee cauſe to be humbled for thoſe works which we were proud of, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times boaſted in. The Prophet (<hi>Haggai</hi> 1.5.) called the <hi>Jews</hi> to <hi>conſider their ways;</hi> they ſaw their wayes, but they conſidered not their wayes, and therefore they ſaw not the evil and error of their wayes. As we ſee many of the works of God, yet ſee not the excellency or admirable contrivance of them, till himſelf ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it; ſo we ſee many of our own works, yet we ſee not the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, vanity, and folly that is in them, till God ſhew it unto us; <hi>he maketh us ſee our work as it is.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, From the circumſtance of time, when it is that the Lord ſheweth unto man his wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Note;
<q>The badneſs or ſinfulneſs of our works, is moſt uſually, and most cleerly diſcovered to us in times of affliction; then ſheweth he them their work.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Joſephs</hi> Brethren did a very ill work in ſelling him into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and in putting off their Father with a lye; yet they took little notice of this work for many years; but when they were bound in fetters, and holden in the cords of affliction, when they came down into <hi>Egypt</hi> for Corn, and were in great ſtreights, through the policy of their Brother to diſcover them, not out of any deſign to hurt them, <hi>Then they ſaid one to another, we are veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guilty concerning our Brother</hi> (Gen. 42.21.)

<pb n="228" facs="tcp:48335:119"/> with the ſtate of a righteous man, that ſin ſhould reigne in him, yet as to this or that act it may reigne; ſin may reigne over, and bring under a godly man by the violence of a preſent tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though it cannot reigne over him (as it doth over the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) by a willing ſubmiſſion. As the beſt ſin alwayes, ſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they have ſinned greatly, they have exceeded. <hi>Davids</hi> ſin exceeded, his ſin, as to that act, maſter'd and reigned over him. <hi>Solomons</hi> ſin exceeded, when in his old age his wives turned away his heart to other gods, (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11.4.) And <hi>Peters</hi> ſin exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when he denied his Maſter. The righteous are not exempt from a particular reigne of ſin, though through grace, they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the reigne of any the leaſt particular ſin. As there is no kind, ſo no degree of ſin, but a godly man may fall into it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that againſt the holy Ghoſt, and totall Apoſtacy from his profeſſion.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God ſheweth them <hi>that they have exceeded,</hi> that's it which God ſheweth them in their affliction.</p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve;
<q>Many ſee their ſin, that do not ſee the exceedingneſs of their ſin, or that they have exceeded in ſin.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not only natural and carnal men, who ſee that they have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, do not at all ſee the exceedingneſs of their ſin, but ſome good men ſee that they have ſinned, but ſee not preſently the exceeding, no nor half, the evil of their ſin; therefore, ſaith <hi>Elihu, He ſheweth them their tranſgreſſion, that they have exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Paul</hi> before his converſion, knew that he had ſinned, but he knew not the ſinfulneſs of his ſin, which yet afterwards was to him exceeding ſinfull, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 7.13.) As it is the height of our corruption to commit ſins exceeding ſinfull, ſo it is a very high poynt of grace, to ſee the exceeding ſinfulneſs of our ſin.</p>
                  <p>You will ſay, how is it that ſin doth exceed, or wherein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts the exceedingneſs of it? I anſwer,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, There is an exceedingneſs of ſin, in the ſtreng<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h that it hath over us, when it doth eaſily command and prevaile, then we ſin exceedingly, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> then ſin is exceeding ſinfull, it hath got a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hand over us. O how ſadly do the ſins of many exceed thus! they are held down by their corruptions as ſlaves and captives, they cannot get themſelves out from under the power of a baſe
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:48335:119"/> luſt. As the devil leads ſome, ſo luſts and corruptions lead others captive at their will, they are at the beck and command of ſin. Thus ſin exceeds in the wicked, who either know not God, or who walk daily contrary to their knowledge.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That man doth exceed in his tranſgreſſion, or his tranſgreſſion doth exceed, who ſins with, or hath a very ill frame of heart in ſinning. Many a good man falls into ſin, and yet he hath not, as I may ſay, a baſe or wicked frame of heart in ſinning, but his very ſinning is, upon the matter, againſt his own heart, and the bent of his ſpirit, his heart goeth not with it. The more of the heart or will is mingled with any ſin, the more exceeding ſinfull it is. I may ſay of ſome men (I would not be miſtaken) <hi>That they do evill with a better frame of heart, than others do good;</hi> there are ſome that do good with very bad, yea with baſe hearts; <hi>The ſacrifice of the wicked is an abomination; how much more when he brings it with a wicked mind,</hi> or (as we put in the Margin) <hi>with wickedneſs,</hi> (Pro. 21.27.) that is, either for applauſe, to be ſeen of men, or for profit, to gain by men, or in malice, the better to compaſs revenge upon any man, or ſort of men; under all which covers, wicked men have brought their ſacrifices, that is, have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the outward worſhip of God, or have taken up the form of godlineſs. And whoſoever doth thus, hath a far worſe frame of heart in doing good, than a good man hath in doing evil: who though he doth evil, yet he delights not in it, and cloſes not with it. By how much any mans heart is more taken with ſin, by ſo much the more ſinfull it is.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The exceedingneſs of a ſin may be meaſured by the circumſtances of ſinning; then a man may be ſaid to tranſgreſs, and exceed in tranſgreſſion, when he ſinneth, Firſt, againſt light, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the checks of his own conſcience within; as alſo, Secondly, when he ſins againſt reproofs, warnings, and admonitions from without; that man exceeds in ſin, who hath been told of it, and yet goeth on. Thirdly, that man exceeds in ſin, who ſins in the midſt of much mercy, and daily received or renewed favours; as alſo he, Fourthly, who ſins in the midſt of many afflictions and judgements, whether upon his perſon and family, or upon the Nation where he liveth: ſuch as theſe not only ſin or tranſgreſs, but exceed in tranſgreſſion. Now the Lord in times of affliction ſheweth men theſe and the like exceedings of their tranſgreſſion,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:48335:120"/> and cauſeth them to confeſs, not only that they are ſinners, and have tranſgreſſed, but they are brought upon their knees to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that they have exceeded in tranſgreſſion. And when this is done, the Lord goeth on yet further to perfect the work of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation and repentance, while they are <hi>bound in fetters, and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the cords of affliction;</hi> for then, as it followeth,

Secondly, vertual. The command of God (I conceive) is here to be underſtood in this latter ſenſe. When the Lord af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicteth the righteous, he vertually commands, or ſends out his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, that they <hi>return from their iniquity.</hi> The word <hi>return,</hi> implyes them formerly following ſome iniquity, &amp; gone far from the Lord: This returning is repenting all the Scripture over. I need ſay no more of that. As by ſin we turn from God, ſo by repentance, we return from iniquity; and as the Lord at all times commands the righteous by his word, ſo they even force him ſometimes to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them by his rod, which is called diſcipline in the former part of the verſe, becauſe ſinners feel paine, and find matter to learn, all at once. <hi>He commandeth that they return</hi>
                     <q>from iniquity.</q>
                  </p>

                     </note> a thing of nought: ſo the Chaldee paraphraſeth it here, <hi>He commands that they return from their evil works, which are like to vanity, and a thing of nought.</hi> What is ſin, but a kind of nothing? we look for great matters from ſin, but it is a vanity, it is (like an Idol) <hi>nothing in the world,</hi> that is, it is not ſuch a thing as it doth import, or as it promiſeth, or as the opinion of men make it to be; Iniquity is no ſuch thing as it pretendeth, or as is pretended. <hi>The Lord commandeth that they return from iniquity;</hi> that is, from doing that which will profit them nothing at all, or no more than a vaine thing, a thing of nothing can. And yet though iniquity be nothing good or profitable, yet 'tis all things evil and hurtfull, nor had any thing ever hurt us or been evil to us, had it not been for ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. <hi>He commandeth that they return from iniquity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Note;
<q>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Affliction hath a voyce; God ſpeaks loudly to us by affliction;</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He ſpeaks to us as loud in his works, as he doth in his word; he trumpets to us, he thunders to us in his works: God ſpeaks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud, but ſweetly, to us in his works of mercy, he ſpeaks aloud, but terribly, to us in his works of judgement.</p>
                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:48335:122"/>
                  <p>Secondly, Seeing, as was touched in opening the words, this command is not to be taken for a ſtanding Law, for ſo God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes commands men to return from iniquity, but the command here is a renewed act or a ſpecial diſpenſation, there is, as it were, a freſh command iſſued, when a man is under the afflicting hand of God.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note;
<q>God reinforceth or reneweth his command to return from ſin, as often as he reneweth our afflictions.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That we return from iniquity, is a ſtanding, an everlaſting Law, but when we are in affliction, then there is, as it were, a freſh E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the command, 'tis, as I may ſay, new printed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, the fetters print this command upon our heels, and the cords upon our hands, that we <hi>return from iniquity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Note;
<q>Iniquity is a vaine thing, it is a nothing.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Shall we not then return from it? one would think a little per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion might ſerve the turn to haſten our return from a nothing, and ſhall not a command do it? when I ſay a nothing, remember, (as was ſhewed) ſin is no ſuch thing as you look upon it to be: where are the profits that you have reaped by ſin? where are the contents and pleaſures that you have taken by ſin? the profit, the pleaſure, and content of ſin are nothing, there is no advantage to be had by ſin. Sin is ſomething in the ill effects of it; if you would have paine, and diſhonour, and reproach, you may have enough of it in ſin, and you will find ſin a ſomething in that ſenſe; but ſin is a nothing, that is, no ſuch thing as you expect and look for, and therefore be perſwaded to return from it.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, From the whole text take notice of the purpoſe of God, what he hath in his heart, when he afflicteth his people, the righteous, for their iniquities and faylings, for their faults and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>even walkings. The ſcope of God in all this, is not their hurt, but good; it is not to deſtroy them for their ſin, but to deſtroy their ſin; it is not to withdraw himſelf from them, but to draw them nearer to himſelf; all the hurt that the Lord intends us by any affliction, is but to get out our droſs, and to fetch out our filth, to bring us off from thoſe things that will undo and ruine us for
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:48335:122"/> ever. And how great an argument of the goodneſs of God is it, that he deſigneth the evils which we ſuffer in theſe dying bodies, to heal the evils, and help on the good of our immortal ſouls! that's all the hurt that the Lord means us. And the Lords heart is ſo much in this deſign (the return of thoſe he afflicts from their iniquity) that he ſeems confident of it, that when any are in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, ſurely they will return, (<hi>Hoſea</hi> 5.15.) <hi>In their afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they will ſeek me early,</hi> ſurely they will. And therefore the Prophet ſpeaks of the Lord as defeated and diſappointed of his purpoſe, when he ſeeth ſuch as he hath afflicted continuing in their ſin, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.13.) <hi>The people turneth not unto him that ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them, neither do they ſeek the Lord of Hoſts:</hi> As if he had ſaid, 'Tis a wonder, that being ſmitten they have not returned; what a ſtrange, what a croſs-grain'd people are theſe! What? doth the Lord ſmite you that you ſhould run farther from him, and follow your iniquity cloſer, or hold it faſter? you may be aſhamed that you turn not unto him that ſpeaks to you; but when you are ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten will you not return from iniquity? remember, the Lord there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuffers you to be bound in fetters, that you may be looſed from your ſins; he therefore ſuffers you to be holden in the cords of affliction, that you might let go your tranſgreſſions. Take heed you be not found diſappointing him of his purpoſe. How well it will be with thoſe who do not diſappoint him, and how ill 'tis like to be with ſuch as do, will appear further and fully in the two next verſes.</p>

                  <p>IN the former Context we heard, what the bleſſed deſignes of God are upon the righteous, when they are bound in fetters, and holden in the cords of affliction, namely, to convince them of their ſin, to fit them for the receiving of Inſtruction, and to bring them clear off from iniquity.</p>
                  <p>In theſe two verſes <hi>Elihu</hi> proceedeth to ſhew what the iſſue of thoſe afflictions will be, in a double reſpect or caſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In caſe the afflicted come up to and anſwer the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned deſignes of God; that is, if they take knowledge of their ſin, if their ears be opened to Inſtruction, if they return from iniquity; what then? he tells us (<hi>v.</hi> 11.) <hi>If they obey and ſerve him, they ſhall ſpend their dayes in proſperity, and their years in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures;</hi> that ſhall be the iſſue, the bleſſed iſſue of all the afflictions with which they were exerciſed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He ſhews us how thoſe afflictions will iſſue in caſe the afflicted come not up to thoſe deſignes of God, in caſe they are not brought to a knowledge of ſin, nor receive inſtruction, nor return from iniquity; what then? he tells us that (<hi>v.</hi> 12.) <hi>if they obey not</hi> (this will be the conſequent of their obſtinacy) <hi>they ſhall periſh by the ſword, and they ſhall die without knowledge.</hi> We have a parallel Scripture to this almoſt in terms, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 19.20.) <hi>If ye hear and obey, ye ſhall eat the good of the Land, but if ye refuſe and rebell, ye ſhall be devoured with the ſword.</hi> This text not only car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the ſenſe, but almoſt the words, by which <hi>Elihu</hi> expreſſeth both the Lords pleaſure and diſpleaſure in this place to <hi>Job.</hi>

                  <p>That is, take out the leſſon taught them; if they do that which the affliction teacheth them, or which God teacheth by their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:48335:123"/> by their cords and fetters, <hi>then,</hi> &amp;c. The ſame word is frequently in Scripture uſed for <hi>obeying</hi> and <hi>hearing, (Pſal.</hi> 81.8, 11, 13. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95.7.) To what purpoſe is our hearing the will of God without obedience to it? When young <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaid at the Lord's call, <hi>Speak, for thy ſervant heareth,</hi> (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.10.) his meaning was, Lord, I am ready to do what thou ſpeakeſt. We hear no more than we obey, and therefore obeying and hearing may well be expreſt by the ſame word. The text is plain, I ſhall only give this Note, and paſs on;
<q>It is our duty to hear and obey when-ever God calls or ſpeakes, either in his word or in his works.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That which this text holds out ſpecially is the voice of God in his works, what God ſpeakes by Fetters, what he ſpeakes by Cords. If ever we hear and obey the voice of the Lord, it ſhould be when he teacheth us (as <hi>Gideon</hi> taught the men of <hi>Succoth, Judg.</hi> 8.16.) <hi>with thornes and briars of the wilderneſs.</hi> O let us take care of hearing and obeying this voice. For Firſt, God is the Lord, and therefore to be obeyed. Secondly, God is a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Lord, and therefore much more to be obeyed. Thirdly, As all the Commands, ſo all the Chaſtiſements of God are juſt and righteous, therefore they are moſt of all to be obeyed. Fourthly, To obey the Commands of God, whether taught us in his Word or by his Rod, is good, yea beſt for us, therefore we ſhould obey for our own good. <hi>If they obey</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>The Lord expects our ſervice, and then eſpecially, when we ſuffer.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Religion and the Worſhip of God, in the whole compaſs of it, is nothing elſe but ſervice, a bleſſed ſervice, a free ſervice, a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice infinitely more free than any thing the world calls freedom.
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:48335:124"/> (<hi>Exod.</hi> 4.23.) <hi>Let my Son go that he may ſerve me,</hi> that is, <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip me.</hi> All the Sons of God are his Servants, and they have moſt of the Son in them who have moſt of the Servant in them. If any deny him ſervice they deny their ſonſhip, or rather (as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaks of <hi>Non-ſufferers</hi> in one kind or other, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.8.) <hi>They are baſtards, not ſons;</hi> yea, God expects whole and all ſervice from us, or that we ſhould ſerve him with our all, (<hi>Deut.</hi> 10.12.) <hi>Thou ſhalt ſerve the Lord thy God with all thy heart.</hi> We muſt ſerve the Lord, not only with the beſt we have, but with all the beſt, with the heart, and all the heart. We ſerve God no further than we obey him, and we worſhip him no further than we ſerve him, and that heartily.</p>
                  <p>To ſerve God, (as to love God) is a very comprehenſive word, 'tis the ſumme of all the duty of Man. To ſerve God is to ſubmit both to what he commands us, and to what he layeth upon us. To ſerve God is to ſubmit to what he would have us do, and to whatſoever he is pleaſed to do with us; and ſo we ſerve him particularly under ſufferings: We ſhould alwayes ſerve him actively, and we are called ſometimes to ſerve him paſſively. All Believers are free, and yet they muſt ſerve; and they are made free on purpoſe to ſerve: We are purchaſed by the blood of Chriſt, that we might ſerve him. <hi>Becauſe we are bought with a price, we muſt not be the ſervants of men,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.23.) Whoſe ſervants then? Surely the ſervants of God.<note place="margin">Servus tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam in bello ſervatus.</note> We are conquered that we might ſerve. The <hi>Latines</hi> ſay, that a <hi>Servant is one that is ſaved in War, taken and ſaved.</hi> So it is with all the people of God, they are taken in the holy war, they are taken priſoners, and ſo made ſervants to Jeſus Chriſt. Yet Believers are ſervants, not only by conqueſt, but compact and covenant; every godly man hath, as it were, ſealed Indentures with God, he hath (upon the matter) put his ear to the Lords poſt to be boared thorow, (as you read, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.6.) that he may be his ſervant for ever. The Lord expects ſervice.</p>
                  <p>But what is it to ſerve him?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To ſerve him is to do his Will.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To ſerve him is to do his whole Will. It is not the doing of this or that piece of the Will of God, or this or that patch of the Will of God, which renders us his ſervants; but the doing his whole Will.</p>
                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:48335:124"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, To ſerve him is to do his Will only; ſo ſaith the Scripture, <hi>Him only ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi> If it may be ſuppoſed, that we could do the whole Will of God, and yet do the will of any other, or do our own will too, in any thing contrary to his, we were not his ſervants; if we ſerve him not alone, or if we ſerve him not only, that is, if in ſerving man we aim not chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the ſerving of him, or if all our ſervices to men are not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient, or not in ſubordination to the ſervice of God, we ſerve him not at all.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, I may add this alſo, To ſerve God is to do every thing under this contemplation, that, what we do is the Will of God. 'Tis very poſſible for a man to do that which is the Will of God, and yet not to ſerve him in doing it; which we never do till we do it becauſe it is the Will of God. His Will muſt be not only the Rule of what we do, but the very Reaſon why we do it, elſe our doings are not his ſervings. They that do not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend this, ſerve God but as a beaſt may ſerve him, a beaſt may do that which is the Will of God; the inanimate creatures ſerve him ſo; We hear of <hi>ſtormy winds and tempeſts fulfilling his Will, (Pſal.</hi> 148.) All living, yea, liveleſs creatures do that which is his Will, but they do not attend this, that it is his Will which they do. So that, I ſay, to do his Will, not conſidering that it is his Will, is to ſerve him no otherwiſe than beaſts, or than the winds or ſtormes ſerve him: And to do his Will, aym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at our own wills or ends, is to ſerve him but as a hypocrite ſerves him. A hypocrite doth not ſerve God in what he doth, though he doth many things which are materially the Will of God, becauſe in all he minds his own will more than the Will of God.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, We muſt ſerve God as Sons, (<hi>Mal.</hi> 3.17.) A Son ſerveth no leſs than a Servant, yea much more, though not as a ſervant; for he knoweth more of his Fathers mind than a meer ſervant doth (<hi>Joh.</hi> 15.15.) and he knoweth, that he ſhall have alſo, though not Wages at the end of every day, yet the inheritance in the end. <hi>Obadiah</hi> was the proper name of one good man, and it is a name common to all good men; they are (as that word imports) <hi>Servants of the Lord.</hi> It is a common Theam to urge men <hi>to ſerve God,</hi> but it is a rare thing to be indeed a ſervant of God. To ſerve God is the Summe and Marrow of all knowledge
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:48335:125"/> in divinity, and the great end why we came into this World and for which we are here detained. Nor is it an eaſie matter to come up to, or attain the holy skill of ſerving ſuch a Lord and Maſter as he: There muſt be a doing of his Will, and of his whole Will, and of his Will only, and that under this preciſe contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, that it is his Will, to denominate us his ſervants, or to make a proof that we ſerve him.</p>
                  <p>Now whether God teacheth us by his Word, or by his Rod (which is the teaching of this context) O how readily ſhould we obey and ſerve him! To ſerve him is not only the deſign of our being made free, that is, we were not onely made free to ſerve him, but to ſerve him is our freedom (as was touch't before) yea, to ſerve him is not onely to be free, but to ſerve him is to reign and rule. They that ſerve God to purpoſe reign over the luſts of the evil World without, and over their own luſts within; nor can any reign over the luſts of the world without, or their own within, but only they who ſerve him, and only ſo far as they ſerve him. Every gracious act of ſervice to God is the ſubjugati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or bringing under of ſome luſt or other in man.</p>
                  <p>Now if any ſhould ſay, ſurely this is a very ſad Life, to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſerving, or to lead only the life of a ſervant.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, To ſerve God, or the ſervice of God is ſweet, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and eaſie in a twofold reſpect. Fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſt, comparatively, to the ſervice of ſin and the world, of luſt and the devil; that's a weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs indeed as well as a baſeneſs. Secondly, It is eaſie alſo if we conſider the help we have in it. The people of God ſerve him in a Covenant of Grace, which, as it calls them to work, ſo it gives them help to work. The New Covenant doth not call us (as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi>) to make brick and deny us ſtraw; yea, under that Covenant, we have not onely ſtraw af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded us to make our brick, but we have ſtrength afforded us to make our brick; thar is, the very power by which we ſerve our Maſter is given in by our Maſter. The Maſters of this world ſet us a work, but they give us no ſtrength, but what work ſoever God ſets his Covenant-ſervants about, he gives them ſtrength to do it. Then, O how ſweet is it to ſerve him, and how readily ſhould our hearts come off in his ſervice! Let me add one thing more (which brings us to the next words) ſerve him, for his is not a lean ſervice, not an unprofitable ſervice, there is a
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:48335:125"/> reward promiſed to thoſe who ſerve him; yea, his very ſervice is a reward, his work is wages. Therefore what calls ſoever we have from him let us anſwer and ſerve him. There are two things which ſhould be the daily meditation of Saints, or they ſhould be continually acquainting themſelves with them. Firſt, <hi>The Croſs of Chriſt,</hi> that they may know how, and be willing to ſuffer for him. Secondly, <hi>The Yoak of Chriſt,</hi> that they may know how, and be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſerve him. <hi>If they obey and ſerve him,</hi> What then? e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that which was the laſt conſideration prove king us to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, there is a reward in i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Proſperity is a good thing, a good bleſſing of God. They ſhall ſpend their dayes in good, we tranſlate it in the 21 Chapter v. 15. <hi>in wealth.</hi> Wealth alſo is a good bleſſing of God to thoſe that are good, and proſperity takes that in; proſperity is a large word comprehending all good, health and wealth, honour and peace: what-ever we can imagine to render our lives comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble comes under the name of Proſperity, <hi>They ſhall ſpend their dayes in proſperity, or in good;</hi> this reward <hi>they</hi> ſhall have from the Lord who ſerve him. Is not this good wages? The carnal rich man pleaſed himſelf and ſaid, (<hi>Luke</hi> 12.19.) <hi>Soul, take thine eaſe, thou haſt goods laid up for many yeares.</hi> The godly do not pleaſe themſelves, that they have goods laid up for many years in their own Stock, in their Lands, in their Houſes, in their Purſes, in their Shops, but they pleaſe themſelves that they have good laid up for many years, yea, for eternity, in the Promiſes of God. They who ſerve him, they ſhall ſpend their dayes in good, they ſhall have good for every day, and ſo finiſh their dayes with good; yet this is not all, <hi>They ſhall ſpend their dayes in proſperity,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>In the former words he promiſed dayes of Good, here years of Pleaſure; as if he had ſaid, they ſhall enjoy their proſperity long, they ſhall not only have Dayes but Years filled up with it. One year containes many dayes, how many dayes of pleaſure are there in years of pleaſure! Our life is meaſured by days to ſhew the ſhortneſs of it; the longeſt meaſure of it is by years; <hi>They ſhall ſpend their years</hi>

                  <p>The word is uſed (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.23.) to ſhew the lovelineſs of <hi>Jonathan</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> they were a pleaſant pair, a couple of goodly perſons. <hi>They ſhall ſpend their dayes in pleaſantneſs, or in pleaſures.</hi>

                  <pb n="243" facs="tcp:48335:126"/>
                  <p>Further, Take notice, the word is plural; he doth not ſay, they ſhall <hi>ſpend their dayes in pleaſure,</hi> but <hi>in pleaſures,</hi> implying all ſorts and varieties of pleaſure; in <hi>Songs,</hi> ſaith one; in <hi>Marriage Songs,</hi> ſaith a ſecond; in <hi>graceful Beauties,</hi> ſaith a third; and, which may be all or any of theſe, in <hi>delights,</hi> ſaith a fourth.</p>
                  <p>But here are two Queſtions that I muſt give anſwer to, for the clearing of this Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The Queſtion may be, <hi>Is this a mercy much to be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon, to ſpend our years in pleaſure?</hi> ſaith not the Apoſtle (1 Tim. 5.6.) <hi>The widow that lives in pleaſure is dead while ſhe lives?</hi> If it be a dead life to live in pleaſure, how then is it here promiſed as a favour, as a mercy, to them that obey and ſerve God, that they ſhall ſpend their years in pleaſures?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer by diſtinguiſhing of pleaſure; pleaſures are of two ſorts. Firſt, lawful and honeſt delights; of ſuch we read (<hi>Gen.</hi> 49.20.) where dying <hi>Jacob</hi> bleſſing of <hi>Aſher</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Dabit deli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ias regis. <hi>Hebr: Mont:</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>He ſhall yield royal dainties,</hi> or <hi>pleaſures for a King;</hi> meaning, he ſhall give, not only honeſt, but honourable pleaſures and contentments, ſuch as befit Kings. Secondly, There are unlawful and diſhoneſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, which the Apoſtle calleth (<hi>Heb.</hi> 11.25.) <hi>the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon.</hi> A wo will be their portion who live in ſuch plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. <hi>Go to now ye rich men, weep and howl</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> Chap. 5.1.) why ſo? among other Reaſons this is given for one (<hi>verſ.</hi> 5.) <hi>Ye have lived in pleaſure,</hi> wantonizing, and gluttonizing, and Epicurizing: in ſuch baſe pleaſures you have lived, therefore wo to you. To live in ſinful or unlawful plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures is death and miſery, or a life worſe than death; but to live a life of lawful and honeſt pleaſure is a mercy, the mercy here promiſed, and the very life of our lives.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We may diſtinguiſh of pleaſures thus; they are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, firſt, Corporal pleaſures, pleaſures of the body, of which we read (<hi>Job</hi> 21.25.) <hi>One dyeth in his full ſtrength, and another dyeth in the bitterneſs of his Soul, and never eateth in pleaſure;</hi> that is, he hath had no contentment in the body, or no bodily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, but was alwayes ſickly, crazy, pining, languiſhing, and ill at eaſe, his life was tedious, even a burden to him, for he could never eat in pleaſure, ſcarce laſt what he did eat. Secondly, There are Spiritual pleaſures (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.8.) <hi>They ſhall drink of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of thy pleaſures. David</hi> ſpeaks there of Saints, what enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:48335:127"/> and Joyes they have in the Church or Houſe of God, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending upon him in holy Ordinances. Thirdly, There are eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal pleaſures (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.11.) <hi>In thy preſence is fulneſs of j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y, and at thy right hand are pleaſures for evermore.</hi> Such are all the joyes of Heaven, or of a glorified ſtate. Now when <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith, <hi>they ſhall ſpend their years in pleaſures,</hi> we are not to take it meerly for honeſt corporal pleaſures, for ſuch a life, at beſt, is but the life of a Beaſt; but we are to take theſe corporal pleaſures, either as heightned by better, that is, as ſpiritualiz'd by the ſenſe of the love of God, and mixed with ſpiritual pleaſures; or, for thoſe purely ſpiritual plea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ures which the ſoul finds in communion with God alone (having nothing to do, or no intercourſe with crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures) drinking at the River of his pleaſures in Prayer, in Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in Meditation, in breaking Bread, in Singing. Now to ſpend our dayes, either in theſe purely ſpiritual pleaſures, taking in alſo thoſe corporal pleaſures ſo qualified as before, and duly circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiated, is a high, a very high bleſſing and mercy indeed. So then, here is nothing to feed the fancy of Epicures, here is no promiſe of ſenſual, though of ſenſitive pleaſures, theſe only are pleaſures ſit for the Servants of God, theſe pleaſures only become Saints; as for thoſe other pleaſures, Chriſt ſaith of them in the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Sower (<hi>Luke</hi> 8.14.) <hi>They choak the Word of God;</hi> and God will not feed his people with ſuch pleaſures, as a reward of ſerving him, as ſhall choak the Word, and unfit them for his ſervice. No, we are to watch againſt, and deny our ſelves ſuch pleaſures, as our Lord Jeſus caution'd his Diſciples (<hi>Luke</hi> 21.34.) <hi>Take heed, leaſt at any time your hearts be over-charged with ſurfetting, drunkenneſs, and the cares of this life, and ſo that day come upon you unawares.</hi> As if he had ſaid, Take heed of carnal pleaſures, as much as of worldly cares, for as they are alike de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to the preſent purity of the Soul, ſo they alike endanger our future peace, and lay us open to the ſurprize of Judgment. And as ſuch pleaſures ruine the ſtate of the ſoul, ſo of the body too, with which they have neareſt cogna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ion. Hence that of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon (Prov.</hi> 21.17) <hi>He that loveth pleaſure ſhall be a poor man.</hi> There, pleaſure is oppoſed to work or labour: He that is all for taking his pleaſure, and will not follow his Calling, this man comes quickly to poverty, and will dye a Beggar. Suppoſe the pleaſure be lawful, yet if he loves pleaſure, and is at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:48335:127"/> when he ſhould be at his labour, he will ſoon be reduced to a morſel of bread, and become a poor man: But he that loveth unlawful pleaſures, ſhall not only be a poor man, but will prove a wicked man. <hi>Thou that art given to pleaſures</hi> (Iſa. 47.8.) is the Character of <hi>Babylon.</hi> God gives good men pleaſure, but 'tis the mark of an evil man to be given to pleaſure. They that <hi>love plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, are lovers of pleaſure more than lovers of God</hi> (2 Tim. 3.4.) and ſuch muſt needs be the worſt of men.</p>
                  <p>And therefore we are not to underſtand this Text of any ſinful pleaſure, nor of a life meerly lead in lawful pleaſure, that a man ſhould be all upon his pleaſure, and lay aſide his Calling; <hi>Elihu</hi> doth not oppoſe pleaſure to work, labour or buſineſs, but to trouble, ſorrow, and affliction. They that obey and ſerve the Lord ſhall ſpend their years in pleaſures, in honeſt pleaſures, that is, they ſhall live, not only contentedly, but joyfully. The Lord al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth us to take any honeſt pleaſure while we live, but not to live in pleaſure; he alloweth us to take our delights, but our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights muſt not take us.</p>
                  <p>There is yet another Query, for it may be ſaid, Is this a truth, that they who obey and ſerve the Lord <hi>ſhall ſpend their dayes in proſperity, and their years in pleaſures?</hi> I anſwer to that,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, If we take it abſolutely and univerſally, we cannot af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that every one who ſerveth and obeyeth God, ſhall alwayes have pleaſure, that is, outward comforts and contentments in this world; many of the Lords faithfull ſervants have lived in paine and ſorrow; ſo that <hi>if</hi> (as <hi>David</hi> ſpake in this caſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.5.) <hi>we ſhould ſpeak thus, we ſhould offend againſt the generation of his ſervants.</hi> Some flouriſh in grace, who wither in worldly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts. There is no certain connexion between theſe two, Grace and outward peace or pleaſure; the providences of God vary in this poynt as himſelf pleaſeth. Neither is it true, that the true ſervants of God do uninterruptedly or alwayes enjoy inward pleaſures, comforts and contentments; for he that feareth the Lord, and obeyeth the voyce of his ſervants, may walk in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and trouble of ſpirit, <hi>and ſee no light,</hi> (Iſa. 50.10.) We are therefore to underſtand this Scripture as others of like nature, of that which is commonly done, or of that which we may upon good ground expect from God, and in faith wait for, that if we ſerve and obey him, he will make our lives comfortable to us. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,</p>
                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:48335:128"/>
                  <p>Secondly, This promiſe, or promiſes of a like nature were fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the time wherein <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpake; he ſpake of the times long before Chriſts appearing in the fleſh, when the Lord did, as it were, lead on his people very much by promiſes, of temporal and outward proſperity, of which the Scripture is more ſparing in the new Teſtament, where we are come to the fulneſs of Chriſt, and the riches of the grace of God to us in him; of which there is but li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tle (comparatively) ſpoken in the old Teſtament: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore under that darker diſpenſation of ſpirituals, the Lord ſaw it good to encourage that people to obedience by a multitude of very particular outward promiſes, as we may read (<hi>Deut.</hi> 28.) He would bleſs their basket and their ſtore, the fruit of the field, &amp;c. Theſe promiſes were ſuted to the ſtate of that under-age people, who were led on and enticed by viſible and ſenſible bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, as we do children with toyes and Gaudees; and indeed all viſible enjoyments are but ſuch in compariſon of ſpirituals. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers under the Goſpel being come to a higher ſtate, to fuller attainments, the promiſes made to them run not much in that channel; yet it cannot be denied, that the Goſpel alſo holds out promiſes for temporals, as well as the Law; and this latter diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of the Covenant as well as the former, hath provided ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently for our outward comforts.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, For anſwer, let us conſider the drift of the Spirit of God in this promiſe of pleaſure. <hi>Job</hi> had often complained of his own ſorrowfull condition, and concluded himſelf a man of ſorrow for all the remainder of his dayes: though his faith was ſtrong for the reſurrection of his body after death, yet he had little, if any faith at all, that he ſhould be raiſed out of that miſerable eſtate wherein he was in this life. He alſo had ſpoken ſomewhat raſhly and amiſs concerning the dealings of God with his ſervants in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, as if nothing but trouble and ſorrow, did attend them, and that the wicked went away with all the ſweet and good of this world. Now <hi>Elihu</hi> to take him off from theſe ſad, and almoſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing thought<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, as to the return of his own comforts, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie his judgement in the general poynt, as to the dealings of God with others; he aſſureth <hi>Job,</hi> that if righteous men being bound in fetters, &amp;c. hear and obey, God will break thoſe bonds, and cut the cords of their affliction, <hi>and they ſhall ſpend</hi> (the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of) <hi>their dayes in proſperity, and</hi> (the reſt of) <hi>their years in
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:48335:128"/> pleaſures.</hi> So that <hi>Elihu</hi> in holding out this promiſe to <hi>Job,</hi> would rather clear his judgement from an error concerning the laſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or continuance of his pains and ſorrows, than heat his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the expectation of joyes and pleaſures in this world.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, I anſwer, Though the people of God have nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes dayes of ſuch outward proſperity, nor years of ſuch ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive pleaſures, yet they have that which is better, and if they have no pleaſures, they do not want them. The Apoſtle could ſay (<hi>Phil.</hi> 4.11.) <hi>I have learned in what ſtate ſcever I am, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to be content.</hi> What is pleaſure if content be not? We may have outward pleaſures, yet no content, but he that hath content within, cannot miſs of pleaſure. A man may have riches, but no contentment, but he that hath contentment is very rich, (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.6.) <hi>Godlineſs with contentment is great gaine,</hi> and great gaine is proſperity: this great gaine, this heart-pleaſure, or ſoul-reſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, is the aſſured portion of thoſe who obey and ſerve the Lord what-ever their outward portion be in this world. And he may be ſaid to ſpend his dayes in good, and his years in pleaſure, who hath theſe pure gaines of gracious contentment, reſting the ſoul in God in all conditions. <hi>The life of man</hi> (that is, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of his life) doth not conſiſt in the abundance of that which he poſſeſſeth, (<hi>Luke</hi> 12.15.) or in ſenſe-pleaſures; but in that ſweet compoſure and ſedateneſs of his ſoul, reſting by faith in the promiſes of God, or rather in the God of the promiſes, and ſo ſucking ſweetneſs from them.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, As though a ſervant of God ſhould be exerciſed with ſorrows all the dayes of his life, yet he cannot be ſaid to ſpend his dayes in ſorrow, becauſe he meets with many refreſhing inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valls and ſhines of favour from the face of God in the midſt of thoſe clouds; ſo he may be ſaid to ſpend his dayes in pleaſure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe at leaſt, when his dayes here are ſpent, he conſummates his dayes (which is one ſignification of the word) by an entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to everlaſting pleaſures.</p>
                  <p>So much for the anſwer of theſe queſtions, concerning this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>They ſhall ſpend their dayes in proſperity, and their years in pleaſure.</hi> From the promiſe it ſelf, Note;

                  </p>
                  <p>God hath no profit by our Obedience, but we have. God doth
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:48335:129"/> not call us to ſerve him in his work, as we call ſervants to do our work, to get his living by us, or better himſelf; no, the Lord calls us to ſerve him and obey him, for our own good. <hi>They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult their own good beſt, who do moſt good.</hi> I may ſay theſe three things of thoſe who do good (and what is ſerving God, but do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of good? or what is doing good but ſerving God?) Firſt, they ſhall receive true good; Secondly, they ſhall for ever hold the beſt good, the chief good, they ſhall not only ſpend their dayes and years in good, but when their dayes and years are ſpent, they ſhall have good, and a greater good than any they had, in ſpending the dayes and years of this life; they ſhall have good in death, they ſhall come to a fuller enjoyment of God, <hi>the chief Good,</hi> when they have left and let fall the poſſeſſion of all earthly goods. Thirdly, they that do good ſhall find all things working together for their good; if they have a loſs, they ſhall receive good by it; if they bear a Croſs, that ſhall bear good. Outward troubles cannot diſturb, much leſs pollute our ſpiritual good; for, <hi>All things work together for good to them that love God, who are the called according to his purpoſe</hi> (Rom. 8.28.) Surely then the ſervice of God is a gainful ſervice, a profitable ſervice; though the work may be hard, and the way painful, yet the wages will be ſweet, and the end pleaſant. The contemplation of this put <hi>David</hi> upon putting that queſtion (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.12, 13.) <hi>What man is he that deſireth life, and loveth many dayes, that he may ſee good</hi> (that is, <hi>that he may enjoy good) keep thy tongue from evil, and thy mouth, that it ſpeak no guile; depart from evil, and do good.</hi> The Pſalmiſt makes Proclamation, What man is he that would have good? let him do good, let him obey and ſerve God, and he ſhall have good.</p>

If we turn to the Lord in affliction, the Lord is ready to turn away our affliction, or (as the Church pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the half turn of her affliction, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 126.4.) <hi>to turn our cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, as the ſtreams in the South;</hi> that is, to make both a moſt admirable and a moſt comfortable turn of our condition. Streams in the hot Southern Countries are rare; the Rain of thoſe Lands uſually is duſt. Streams in the South are alſo very welcome: How glad are they of a cooling Showre from a Cloud, who daily feel, and are fainted with the ſcorching Beams of the Sun! Such a turn ſhall they have (ſaith <hi>Elihu</hi>) who being holden in the cords of affliction, turn from iniquity, obey and ſerve the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, From the matter of the Promiſe,</p>
                  <p>Note;
<q>A comfortable paſſage through this life, is a very great mercy, as well as the hope of happineſs for ever in the other life.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis proſperity and pleaſure in this world, though nor meer worldly proſperity and pleaſure, which is here p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iſed; and we are not to ſlight any thing that comes by promiſe, yea, we ſhould highly eſteem thoſe things, which, conſidered in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:48335:130"/> are little worth, as they come to us through the Promiſe. We may quickly over-rate and over-reckon outward things in themſelves, and we ever do ſo, if we rate or reckon them any better than vanity; but as they are promiſed and beſtowed in a way of ſavour from God, and as they are a part of the purchaſe of Chriſt, and handed to us by him (ſo are even outward things to believers) thus they are very valuable. Upon theſe terms to live and ſpend our dayes in good, and our years in honeſt lawful pleaſures, is a great mercy.</p>
                  <p>From the whole take two Corolaries.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>How blaſphemous then is their Opinion, who ſay it is a vain thing to ſerve the Lord, or that there is no profit in calling upon him!</hi> which blaſphemy was reſuted <hi>Chap.</hi> 21.14.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Would we have a good end of, or out-gate from our afflictions, then let us hear and obey. Thus much of the firſt caſe, what the iſſue of their afflictions ſhall be, who obey: The Second iſſue upon the contrary caſe, followeth in the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe.</p>
                  <q>
                     <bibl>
                        <hi>Verſ. 12.</hi>
                     </bibl> But if they obey not, they ſhall periſh by the Sword, and dye without knowledge.</q>
                  <p>Here contraries are ſet one over againſt another, for their fuller illuſtration. <hi>If they obey not;</hi> that is, if thoſe righteous men ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of before (<hi>verſ.</hi> 7.) <hi>obey not.</hi> What it is not to obey, is clear by what I ſaid was to obey, in opening the former verſe. I ſhall only take notice, that in this latter part it is not ſaid, <hi>If they obey not, and ſerve him not,</hi> but only, <hi>if they obey not;</hi> and I conceive, <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith no more, or proceeds no further, becauſe they who deny obedience, will certainly deny ſervice; therefore he ſtops at that.</p>
                  <q>If they obey not.</q>
                  <p>They who are good in their ſtate, may often fail in doing that which is good; for of thoſe this Text yet ſpeaks, and is generally interpreted. The Hypocrite in heart is ſpoken of in the next verſe, but here <hi>Elihu</hi> is ſpeaking of the righteous, and becauſe he is ſo, therefore by this diſobedience cannot be meant an obſtinate rebellion, but a ſloth or careleſneſs in attending to the Call of God, for the amendment of ſome evil in their lives. <hi>If they obey not:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="251" facs="tcp:48335:130"/>
                  <p>Hence Note;
<q>The calls and commands of God are not alwayes obeyed, no not by good men, not by the righteous.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The call and command of God is not at all obeyed by the wicked, and it is not alwayes obeyed by the righteous. The righteous ſometimes hear the word, but do not anſwer it, and ſometimes they feel the rod, and do not attend it; they cry out of the ſmart of the rod, and of the ſores which the laſhes of the rod have made upon them, they weep over, or becauſe of their ſores, yet they do not preſently give glory to God by obeying him, and leaving their ſinnes, I mean as to that ſpecial point of duty in which God would have them obey him, and as to thoſe ſpecial ſins which God by that affliction calls upon them to leave. Many good men do not preſently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the purpoſe of God in this or that affliction; and while it is ſo with them, they muſt needs fail in anſwerableneſs to it. I know every godly man hath a general bent to obey God and ſerve him. It is not with the godly in their afflictions as with the wicked under theirs, of whom the Prophet ſpeaks, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.13.) <hi>They did not turn to him that ſmote them;</hi> yet even ſuch Scriptures are in a degree applicable to many of the people of God, <hi>they do not alwayes turn to him that ſmiteth them;</hi> when they are exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed with variety of calamities, they mind not the Lord as they ought. And hence it is (I ſay) that though the righteous have a general bent to obedience, yet they ſometimes come ſhort of that obedience which a ſpecial affliction or correction calleth them to; yea, they may be ſo ſhort in anſwering it, that the Lord may proceed to lay heavier and greater afflictions upon them, even to the taking of them out of the world, as it followeth in this verſe, <hi>If they obey not</hi>
                     <q>They ſhall periſh by the ſword.</q>

Some good men have acknowledged in great trials and ſufferings, under the hand of man, that God hath met with them for their neglect or non-attendance to more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate afflictions under his own hand. Again, take the ſword tropically or improperly, and ſo any ſore affliction that greatly annoyeth, eſpecially if to death, is called <hi>a ſword</hi> in Scripture; <hi>They ſhall periſh by the ſword</hi> (under one notion or other) <hi>if they do not obey.</hi>

<q>God will not ſpare, no not his own People, if they do not obey him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>God is full of ſparing-mercy, but the righteous may provoke him ſo, that he will not ſpare, no not them. Judgement begins often at the houſe of God (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.17.) <hi>And if Judgement begin at the houſe of God, what ſhall the end be of thoſe that obey not the Goſpel?</hi> This is a terrible word. The righteous may periſh by the ſword; how dreadfully then ſhall the unrighteous, the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the ſcorners of godlineſs, periſh! If God will make his own people ſmart in his anger, when they provoke him, how will he <hi>ſpeak to his enemies in his wrath, and vex them in his fore diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> (Pſal. 2.5.)</p>
                  <p>Secondly, From the gradation of their troubles; Firſt, they were <hi>bound in fetters and holden in cords,</hi> but now here's a ſword, a devouring ſword, a killing deadly weapon.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Knowledge may be taken in a more general ſenſe, and ſo no righteous man either lives or dies without knowledge? he neither lives nor dies without the knowledge of God in Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>whom to know is eternal life, (John</hi> 17.3.) and without the knowledge of whom, all (who are actually capable of ſuch know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) muſt die eternally; he neither lives nor dies without the knowledge of himſelf as a ſinner, and of Chriſt who ſaveth him from his ſins. Such ignorances are inconſiſtent with the ſtate of a godly man; he may do fooliſhly, but he is not a fool; he may be wanting in ſome kind of knowledge, but he doth not want knowledge; he cannot be without ſaving knowledge, though he may periſh (temporally) <hi>without knowledge.</hi> The firſt thing that God makes in the new creation is light, the light of knowledge, there he begins his work; therefore we cannot take knowledge generally, ſimply and abſolutely, in this text;<note place="margin">Dei monita per caſtigationes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Further we may expound the words thus; <hi>They ſhall die with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowledge,</hi> that is, without the knowledge or conſideration of of that ſpecial affliction or judgement which is coming upon them,<note place="margin">Non eſt oratio affirmativa ſtultitiae vel negativa ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiae, ſed ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitèr negat advertentiam. <hi>Bold.</hi>

According to this interpretation, <hi>Elihu</hi> intends either their inadvertency of that approaching ſcourge or calamity with which they are overtaken, or their not underſtanding the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it. Chriſt ſaith in the Goſpel (<hi>Luke</hi> 12.46.) <hi>The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of that ſervant (the evil ſervant) ſhall come in a day which he knowes not of, and in a time when he looked not for him.</hi> Now, as the laſt Judgement, the great Judgement ſhall come upon the wicked in a time when they look not for it, ſo the Lord may bring a ſpecial particular judgement upon ſome one or more of his own people, when they do not think of it, or never ſuſpected that they ſhould fall under it. Good men are ſometimes ſurprized; and ſo, <hi>they ſhall die without knowledge,</hi> is no more than this, they ſhall be taken unawares by a ſuddain unexpected judgement. Though every godly man hath a preparation for the general judgement, yet as to a particular one, he may be much unprepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Some expound the words of more than inadvertency, or bare neſcience, even of folly, and ſome degree of affected igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, which poſſibly may prevaile upon a righteous man in ſome caſes and for a time; but I rather adhere to the former interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, becauſe (as was ſhewed before) the whole context ſeems to intend a more ordinary caſe of a righteous man. So then, this Scripture holds out the ſad iſſues which the neglect of giving God the glory of his corrections and chaſtenings may bring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the righteous.</p>

<q>Diſobedience, or neglect of duty, is dangerous, whereſoever it is found.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> felt this; many of them died (in the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:48335:132"/> ſence given) without knowledge, or not having a due ſpiritual knowledge of Chriſt in the holy ſupper, which the Apoſtle calls, their <hi>not diſcerning the Lords body,</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.29.) and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently tells them (<hi>ver.</hi> 30.) <hi>for this cauſe many are weak and ſickly among you, and many ſleep;</hi> that is, are taken away by death. <hi>Any kind or degree of ſin is dangerous;</hi> not to obey a hint of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, not to obey an intimation of the mind of God in an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, may be very dangerous; afflictions may end in deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and fetters in death, if the purpoſe of God in them be not attended and anſwered by us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly note;
<q>Not to obey when God calls and commands, is folly and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such do as if they had no knowledge at all what or how to do.</p>

<q>The ignorance and heedleſneſs of men undo them, and bring de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction upon them.</q>

Wicked men are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done by acting againſt their knowledge; good men may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done by acting below their knowledge, or by not acting accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what they know or ſhould have known; and ſo (through their ignorance or heedleſneſs) <hi>they dye without knowledge.</hi>

                     <hi>ELihu</hi> having put the caſe of the righteous in theſe two condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional propoſitions laſt opened, as ſomewhat doubtful, what at leaſt ſome of them may do, as to a right-improvement of outward afflictions; he proceeds in theſe two verſes to ſhew the caſe of the wicked wholly deſperate, in their affliction. There is an <hi>if</hi> put upon the righteous, but he is concluſive upon the hypocrite; to be ſure he will neither hear nor obey, neither ſubmit nor conform to the voyce of the rod.</p>

                        <pb n="257" facs="tcp:48335:133"/> ſnared;</hi> Therefore I intend not here to revive that ſubject, but ſhall only a little open the additional tearm or amplification which is here put upon the hypocrite. <hi>Elihu</hi> doth not ſay barely, <hi>hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites heap up wrath,</hi> but, <hi>The hypocrites in heart heap up wrath;</hi> as implying ſome ſpecial character and brand of hypocriſie upon the perſons here aimed at. <hi>An hypocrite in heart</hi> is no more but this, nor is it any thing leſs than <hi>an hearty hypocrite;</hi> he is one that is not to the halves, but wholly hypocritical; he that is but half with God (ſuch is the hypocrite) is wholly profane, wholly wicked. The ſame word which ſignifyeth an hypocrite ſignifyeth a profane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſo we put it in the margine of this text, <hi>The hypocrite,</hi> or <hi>the profane in heart.</hi> This expreſſion is very paralel with that of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul (Col.</hi> 1.21.) <hi>Ye that were ſometimes alienated and enemies in your mind, by wicked workes, yet now hath he reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</hi> He doth not only call natural men <hi>enemies</hi> to God, as indeed they all are, <hi>(the wiſdome of the fleſh is enmity againſt God)</hi> But he calls them <hi>enemies in their minds,</hi> that is, ſuch as have a mind to be enemies, or ſuch as have a good will to do evil. So here, <hi>an hypocrite in heart</hi> is a man heartily hypocritical; whoſoever is an hypocrite is an hypocrite in heart; Hypocriſie is that which lyeth at the bottome, it is an heart-ſin: though hypocirſie act and vent it ſelf at the tongue, and by the hand, yet all hypocriſie lyeth at the heart; nevertheleſs, every hypocrite is not (ſtrictly taken) an <hi>hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite in heart.</hi> The hypocrite in heart is oppoſed to the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in heart, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 92.11.) The hypocrite in heart hath a heart as full of hypocriſie, as the upright in heart would have hearts full of uprightneſs. Yet further to characterize the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite in heart,</p>
                  <p>Take theſe three conſiderations to clear it;<note place="margin">Data opera in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius eſt.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, an hypocrite in heart is one who doth evil, not out of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, but our of deſigne; not becauſe he cannot do otherwiſe, but becauſe he will not, and is reſolved on it; ſuch a ſinful piece or ſuch a piece of ſinfulneſs is the <hi>hypocrite in heart;</hi> he ſins as he ſhould love and ſerve and obey God, with all his heart.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as this hypocrite doth evil upon deſign, ſo alſo he doth good with a wicked mind. It is poſſible for a man to do good unſincerely, or not to be ſincere in the doing of it, and yet not to do it with a wicked mind and purpoſe, or with a baſe deſign. There are many who do good, who come to duty, whether in
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:48335:134"/> family or congregation, who mind not what they do, nor have any love to it, or zeal for it; here is hypocritical attendance, in that they ſet not themſelves to meet with God or find God in the duty; yet poſſibly ſuch come not with a wicked purpoſe, nor with a plot in their heads in doing theſe duties, that's proper to the hypocrite in heart. Thus we may underſtand that of <hi>Solomon,</hi> lately opened upon another occaſion, (<hi>Prov.</hi> 21.27.) <hi>The ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord; how much more when he bringeth it with a wicked mind!</hi> A man may be wicked as to his ſtate, yet not do a thing with a wicked mind, not bring a ſacrifice (which includeth all holy ſervices) with an unholy pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: but the hypocrite in heart when-ever he doth any good, hath a plot in it; as he alwayes ſerves God with a reſerve, he hath ſomewhat that he doth with-hold, he cometh by halves, ſo he alwayes ſerves God with a deſign. He may make a fair ſhew, and a great noiſe in profeſſion, but ever he hath ſome end of his own in it. <hi>Jehu</hi> ſaid, <hi>Come ſee my zeal for God.</hi> He was about a good work, the deſtroying of <hi>Ahabs</hi> Houſe, and <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts, this he called zeal for the Lord; but he did all this with a wicked mind; for the great thing upon his heart was to get into the Throne, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o be a King, he made uſe of all thoſe ſpecious acts of zeal only as a ſtirrup to raiſe himſelf into the ſaddle, the matter he aimed at was to eſtabliſh the kingdom of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to himſelf and his poſterity. That's a ſecond thing; as the hypocrite doth evil purpoſely, ſo when he doth good he hath a purpoſe, a plot in it, more than is good; he doth it not, either for the honour of God, or for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of God, which are the beſt ends of every good action, and without a pure eye, without which no action, how good ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in it ſelf, is good to, or turnes to the good of the actor.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The <hi>hypocrite in heart,</hi> I conceive, is ſuch a one as knows himſelf to be an hypocrite. There are many hypocrites, who little thinke that they are hypocrites, yea, they may think themſelves very upright and honeſt in what they do; ignorant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded ſouls, underſtand not their own caſe. <hi>Laodicea</hi> was wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and miſerable, theſe are falſe and hypocriticall, but know it not. As ſome judge, or rather miſ-judge themſelves hypocrites, who are upright in the maine with God, and honeſt at heart, (How frequent are ſuch complaints, and ſelf-wronging accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?)
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:48335:134"/> So many are hypocrites, or rotten at heart, who know it not. <hi>The heart is deceitfull above all things,</hi> (ſaith the Prophet <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.9.) <hi>and deſperately wicked, who can know it?</hi> And among all men, common hypocrites know leaſt o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, that he may appear what he is not, or what he knows himſelf not to be; He knoweth in himſelf that he is naught, while he would be known by and to others as good. The Apoſtle ſpeaking of the grievous ſufferings of ſome primitive Chriſtians, ſaith (<hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34.) <hi>They took joyfully the ſpoyling of their goods, knowing in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that they have a better and a more enduring ſubſtance;</hi> that is, they knew they were in a preſent gracious ſtate, and that there remained for them an eternal happy ſtate. Thus alſo an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite in heart, is one that <hi>knoweth in himſelf,</hi> or in his heart, that he doth but pretend to be good, and that whatſoever good he doth, it is only in pretence, and is therefore (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the Heretick, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.11.) <hi>condemned of himſelf,</hi> while he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quits or commends himſelf never ſo well to others. Thus it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears how bad, how baſe the hypocrite in heart is in his beſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, and how much he excels and bears away the Bel fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſeneſs and badneſs, I may ſay, for madneſs too, from all common hypocrites. Now as they exceed in ſin, ſo they ſhall in miſery, the next words aſſure us of that; <hi>But the hypocrites in heart</hi>

                     </note>Firſt, Some conceive that <hi>Elihu</hi> meaneth their own wrath. Hypocrites in heart heap up wrath, that is, when God doth at any time bind them in fetters, and holdeth them in the cords of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, as he ſpake in the former context, theſe hypocrites in heart, what do they? Do they obey? Do they turn from iniquity? Do they amend their hearts or lives? No; <hi>They heap up wrath,</hi> they grow angry, they vex and rage inſtead of repenting; that's all theſe hypocrites do; when the Lord hath bound them in fetters, and holds them in the cords of affliction, they are all in a ſlame, they are mad with rage and fury. Some both of the Ancients and Moderns, inſiſt upon this opinion, and it is a very great truth, that when the hypocrite ih heart is under the hand of God, when God hath him faſt in his fetters, his wrath doth boyl, his fury comes up in his face, as it is ſaid (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 38.18.) concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the wrath of God towards his enemies: this fully anſwers that aſſertion of <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> (Job 5.2.) <hi>Wrath killeth the fooliſh man.</hi> What wrath? his own wrath; he kills himſelf with vexing and fretting. The hypocrite in heart is a wrathfull man, when things go not right with him. Some have ſo expounded that (<hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3.) <hi>Ye were by nature children of wrath, even at others. Children of wrath,</hi> that is, <hi>wrathfull children;</hi> we are full of wrath, full of anger by nature. Though I do not take that to be the ſenſe of the Apoſtle; but that by <hi>children of wrath,</hi> he means all men as borne under the wrath of God, nor do I conceive this the proper meaning here, though not unuſefull. <hi>They heap up wrath,</hi> that is, they grow angry, vexed, and troubled; But</p>
                  <pb n="261" facs="tcp:48335:135"/>
                  <p>Secondly, Rather the wrath heaped up, is the wrath of God, which is the moſt dreadfull thing in the world; and ſo theſe words may be expounded by thoſe of the Apoſtle to an impenitent ſinner (<hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4, 5.) <hi>Deſpiſeſt thou the riches of his goodneſs, and forbearance, and long-ſuffering, not knowing that the goodneſs of God leadeth thee to repentance: But after thy hardneſs and impenitent heart treaſureſt up unto thy ſelf wrath againſt the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of God. To heap up wrath,</hi> and, <hi>to treaſure up wrath,</hi> are the ſame. The abuſers of the patience and long-ſuffering of God, are treaſuring up wrath againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from day to day; and ſo do the hypocrites in heart, <hi>They heap up wrath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Note, Firſt,
<q>The wicked or hypocrites in heart, grow more wicked while the hand of God, his afflicting hand, is upon them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The more they are under the rod, the more they rebell. I ground it upon this; If they did not heap up ſin, they ſhould not heap up wrath; were they not more vile &amp; wicked under their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, there would not be more anger againſt them. It was ſaid of thoſe that would have brought in the captives (which was a very op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing purpoſe, (2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 28.13.) ye ſhall not; for <hi>Whereas we have effended againſt the Lord already, ye intend to add more to our ſins &amp; to our treſpaſſe.</hi> Then preſently followeth, <hi>For our treſpaſſe is great, and there is fierce wrath againſt Iſrael.</hi> As if it had been ſaid, If ye do this thing ye will increaſe the wrath of God (which is very fierce already) and blow it up into a conſuming flame. While men grow more and more wicked and vile, God groweth (as to the manifeſtations of wrath) more wrathfull. When we hear of the increaſe of wrath, we may be ſure there hath been a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable increaſe of ſin. It is ſaid of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> who was a hypocrite in heart, a very prophane perſon, (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.22.) that <hi>in the time of his diſtreſſe he treſpaſſed yet more againſt the Lord,</hi> and treſpaſſing more againſt the Lord, he heaped up more of the Lords wrath againſt himſelf: For 'tis added, (<hi>v.</hi> 23.) <hi>He ſacrificed to the gods of Damaſcus which ſmote him;</hi> he got nothing but blows, for his paines, or impious piety in ſerving them: <hi>And he ſaid, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the gods of the Kings of Syria help them, therefore will I ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to them, that they may help me.</hi> But what got he by this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:48335:136"/> of his ſin? Surely nothing, but an encreaſe of wrath; for, it followeth in the ſame verſe, <hi>They were the ruine of him and of all Iſrael.</hi> God makes new rods, when men make new ſins; and he multiplyeth ſwords, while men multiply tranſgreſſions. The more men draw iniquity with cords of vanity, the more they draw mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery upon themſelves, and are held the faſter in the cords of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, When 'tis ſaid, <hi>The hypocrites in heart heap up wrath.</hi> We know hypocrites are cunning gameſters, they hope to ſin ſo cloſely and artificially, that no hurt ſhall ever come to them by it, yet <hi>The hypocrites in heart heap up wrath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Note;
<q>The wiles and policies of hypocrites will availe them nothing;</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>They ſhall not avoyd wrath, do what they can; the Lord will find them out. The Apoſtle ſaith (<hi>Gal.</hi> 6.7.) <hi>God is not mocked; for whatſoever a man ſoweth, that ſhall he alſo reap; for he that ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to his fleſh, ſhall of the fleſh reap corruption; but he that ſoweth to the Spirit, ſhall of the Spirit reap life everlaſting.</hi> Let hypocrites <hi>in heart</hi> ſow as cunningly as they can, though they ſeem to ſow only good ſeed, yet they ſhall reap bad fruit, becauſe they ſowed with a bad heart. Hypocrites may deceive men, and heap up their favours to themſelves, but they cannot deceive God, who knows their hearts, and will therefore conſume them in his wrath, which they have heaped up to themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Elihu</hi> puts it upon hypocrites in heart to be at this work of heaping up wrath. All impenitent ſinners do it, but he puts it upon them eſpecially. All ſinners, open profeſſed ſinners, that ſin and hide it not, that throw up even the very name and profeſſion of Religion, theſe all heap up wrath; yet they heap up moſt, and are here ſpoken of, as the only helpers up of wrath, who are <hi>hypocrites in heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Note;
<q>God is extreamly angry with hypocrites, or the wrath of God doth burn extreamly hot againſt hypocrites;</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He heats the Furnace of his wrath ſeven times hotter for <hi>hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites in heart,</hi> than for ordinary ſinners. The Lord (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 10.5.) ſpeaking of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> ſaith, <hi>The ſtaff in their hand is mine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation:
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:48335:136"/> I will ſend him againſt an hypocriticall Nation, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the people of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the ſpoyle, and to take the prey, and to tread them down, like the mire in the ſtreets.</hi> The Lord put a ſtaff in the hand of that great King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> and he called it <hi>his indignation;</hi> it was the <hi>Lords in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation</hi> which was a ſtaff in the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> hand. But againſt whom will he ſend it? That text anſwers <hi>againſt an hypocriticall Nation;</hi> Who are they? <hi>the people of his wrath.</hi> God hath wrath for all ſinners, but the generation of hypocrites are the people of his wrath beyond all other people. None abuſe God like hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites: For, firſt, hypocrites carry it towards God, as if he were like the Idols of the Heathen, that have eyes, and ſee not ears, and hear not, hands, and handle not; feet, and cannot walk: That is, they carry it towards God as if he were but an Idol, ſatisfied with meer outward ſhews and ſervices. An Idol ſinds no fault, nor troubles any for their hypocriſie and falſe-heartedneſs: All that is required in the Idols ſervice, is but outſide and bodily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe. Thus the hypocrites deal with God, as if he alſo would be ſatisfied and taken up with a little outſide ſervice; or as if ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice would pleaſe him, when his word is diſobeyed, (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.23.) <hi>Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and Sacrifices, as in obeying the voyce of the Lord <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Saul</hi> had been very carefull to bring home ſacrifices; He had not obeyed the command of God, yet hoped to put him off with a ſacrifice. But what were heards and flocks of cattel to be ſacrificed, when <hi>Saul</hi> rebelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God? Nothing provokes God more than outward ſervices of worſhip, when they are not accompanied with inward, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal ſubmiſſion to his will; for that's <hi>no better</hi> a ſacrifice, no pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer worſhip, than a Heathen payes to his Idol-god. Hypocrites offer God only <hi>the blind, and the lame,</hi> (Mal. 1.14.) that is, maymed and imperfect ſervices: there is imperfection in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of the beſt, but theirs are imperfect ſervices, ſo imperfect, blind and lame, that they are fit only for <hi>the blind, and the lame;</hi> ſo Idol-gods are called, (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.8.) And do not they heap the wrath of the true God, who ſerve him no better than falſe gods are ſerved, by their Idolatrous Devo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ioniſts!</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There muſt needs be a continual heaping up of wrath by Hypocrites; for, if not to ſet the heart right provokes God to wrath, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.8.) The Lord was exceedingly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:48335:137"/> with the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> becauſe <hi>they ſet not their heart aright.</hi> Now if the Lord be ſo angry when the heart is not ſet aright) much more muſt it provoke the Lord, when then do purpoſely ſet their hearts wrong, when they do evil knowingly, adviſedly, when, as it were, they ſtudy to do evil. To do good only in ſhew, doth more diſpleaſe the Lord, than the doing of that which in ſhew is evil, or which is evil above-board, known to be ſo by all beholders. As Hypocrites often deceive men, ſo they attempt to deceive God himſelf. This cannot but heap up wrath, being it ſelf ſo great a heap of ſin. They who think God will be pleaſ'd with outward Services alone, or have no care to give him inward, are alike diſpleaſing to him. Therefore, among all ſorts of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, the Lord declares his wrath, and thunders woe upon woe, in the Goſpel, againſt Hypocrites: They have heaped up wrath, and it ſhall be heaped upon them, <hi>They ſhall have their Portion in the Lake that burneth with fire and brimſtone.</hi> That's the firſt thing, what they do, <hi>They heap up wrath.</hi> When the hand of God is upon them, they are ſo far from coming forth humbly and penitentially to turn away his wrath, or to ſeek his face, that they provoke him more and more, and dreadfully enflame the reckoning againſt themſelves; <hi>They heap up wrath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Elihu</hi> tells us what the <hi>Hypocrites in heart</hi> do not; <hi>They cry not when h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

Are we commanded or bound to cry, when we are bound in fetters, and holden in cords of affliction? wherein lyeth this ſin? That will appear while I ſhew what crying is here intended.</p>
                  <p>To cry, is, Firſt, to complain and make a noyſe; this is the cry of impatience. Secondly, to mourn and be ſorrowful; this is the cry of Repentance. Thirdly, to pray, to ſupplicate, yea, to pray mightily, to pray ſtrongly; and this is the cry of Faith. (<hi>Luke</hi> 18.7.) <hi>Shall not God avenge his own Elect, which cry day and night unto him?</hi> That is, which pray mightily to him night and day. The hypocrite in heart often makes the firſt cry when God bindeth him, the cry of impatience, but never the two latter; he makes not, either the cry of Repentance, or the cry of Faith in Prayer, when God bindeth him. This lets us ſee the ſecond Part of the wickedneſs of theſe hypocrites, 'tis the omiſſion of a moſt neceſſary duty, yea of two: They act very ſinfully, for
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:48335:137"/> 
                     <hi>they heap up wrath;</hi> they act not holily, for they do not cry when God binds them; that is, they neither repent nor pray, or they repent not heartily, they pray not earneſtly, in the day of their affliction.</p>
                  <p>Hence note, Firſt;
<q>Hypocrites humble not themſelves, when God humbleth them;</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>When he binds them as it were hand and foot, they are tongue-tyed and heart-tyed. The Lord ſaid of ſuch (<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.14.) <hi>They cryed not unto me with their heart, when they howled upon their beds; they aſſemble themſelves for Corn and Wine, and rebel againſt me.</hi> They howled and made a noyſe, but (ſaith the Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d) all the while they cryed not to me. There was no Repentance, no Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in their cry, they cryed not with their heart. Hypocrites will, firſt, complain much when God binds them; ſecondly, they mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure much when God binds them; thirdly, they will vex them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves like a Bull in a Nett, when God binds them; Fourthly, they will rail and curſe when God binds them; but repent, or pray they do not. (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.21.) <hi>They ſhall paſs through it hardly beſted and hungry; and it ſhall come to paſs, that when they ſhall be hungry, they ſhall fret themſelves, and curſe their King and their God, and look upward.</hi> Here was blaſpheming, but no crying, no repenting, no praying, no deprecating the hand of God, or the Judgment felt, in an humble and ſpiritual way. Hypocrites cry not to the Lord, though he makes them cry; they are readier to find fault with God, than with themſelves, in the day of adverſity: they neither cry the cry of godly ſorrow for their ſin, nor the cry of godly Prayers, for help out of their affliction. <hi>They who are falſe with God in times of Peace, ſeldom, if at all, repent, or duty ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themſelves to God for help in times of trouble;</hi> the reaſon is, The Conſcience of the <hi>hypocrite in heart,</hi> tells him,<note place="margin">Anteactae tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Such hypocrites often cry out deſpai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ingly, but oh how rately are they brought to cry, either believingly or repentingly, when God <hi>bindeth them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Conſider this cry a little further, as a Prayer-cry. Hypocrites in heart may be much for prayer in time of proſperity, they were not hypocrites elſe; if they did not pray, they were
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:48335:138"/> openly prophane, not hypocrites. Chriſt ſpeaking of hypocrites, (<hi>Math.</hi> 6.) tells us, they pray much, and (<hi>Math.</hi> 7.) they <hi>cry Lord, Lord.</hi> Hypocrites are much in praying, eſpecially in times of proſperity, yet here he ſaith, <hi>They cry not when he bindeth them,</hi> that is, in the day of adverſity.</p>
                  <p>Hence Obſerve;
<q>That which is not done uprightly, will not be done conſtantly.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hypocrites cry to God only in ſhew at beſt, and when 'tis beſt with them; but when they fall into a troubled condition, they cry not, they even lay down their ſhew; they throw up their duties, when they miſs their deſires. They who have prayed often in a time of proſperity, not throwing away their ſins, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into affliction they throw away their prayers. Prayer will forſake them, who forſake God while they pray. Such as want Faith, will not have a heart to pray in their wants. If holy Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties cauſe us not to leave our ſins, ſinning will at laſt cauſe us to throw off our holy Duties, <hi>Will,</hi> or doth, <hi>the hypocrite pray al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes?</hi> was <hi>Jobs</hi> denying queſtion, at the 27th Chapter of this Book. They who do not love prayer, cannot hold out in prayer: They who do not find a ſweetneſs in drawing near to God in good Times, will ſoon withdraw from him in evil Times.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>They cry not when he binds them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note;
<q>Hypocrites, when they have moſt need of prayer, are leaſt in the uſe of it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>When more need of Prayer, than in time of affliction? yet the hypocrite bound in affliction is bound in ſpirit from ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, They are ſaid not to cry, though (in ſome ſenſe, as hath been ſhewed) they do cry when God bindeth them.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note;
<q>That holy Duty, which is not rightly and holily done, is reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God as not done at all.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>What almoſt is more common among hypocrites, yea, among ſome prophane ones, than to p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ay, and deſire others to pray for them in time of affliction? <hi>Pharaoh</hi> will needs have <hi>Moſes</hi> pray
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:48335:138"/> for him; and when <hi>Ahab</hi> was threatned with a binding he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himſelf; yet this goes for nothing, and gets nothing, at moſt, but what <hi>Ahab</hi> got a reprieve from ſome preſent or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Thoſe words are brought in as an aggravation of the ſinfulneſs of the hypocrite; he doth not <hi>cry when God binds him,</hi> he prayeth not when God afflicts him.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note;
<q>It is an heightning of our ſin, to neglect prayer in time of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is a ſin to neglect prayer at any time, but their ſin is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſinful, who neglect it then, who cry not to God, when God binds them. Is it not extreamly evil, that they ſhould not pray at all, or but little, when they ſhould be all and alwayes in prayer? Affliction doth, as it were, naturally draw us, yea, forcibly drive us to God. <hi>In their affliction they will ſeek me early</hi> (Hoſ. 5.14.) As if the Lord had ſaid, If ever they will ſeek me, ſurely they will ſeek me then, and then they will ſeek me <hi>early,</hi> that is, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, and with all their hearts. Therefore how unnaturally ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full are they, who in their affliction will not ſeek God! The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſaith (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.16.) <hi>Lord, in trouble have they viſited thee, they powred out a prayer when thy chaſtening was upon them:</hi> Yet the hypocrite will not pray when chaſtened. How ſinful it is, not to pray when God binds us, appears upon many accounts.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To neglect prayer in time of affliction, is very ſinful, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then we have moſt occaſion for it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In time of affliction God eſpecially calls us to pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; he commands us at all times, but chiefly then. <hi>Is any among you afflicted?</hi> (is that any mans caſe?) <hi>let him pray</hi> (Jam. 5.14.) What ſhould an afflicted man do elſe? What is he ſo much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd to do by his own neceſſity, what ſo much by the will of God, as to p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ay? Affliction, which takes us off from many other wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ks, ſets us upon and about this.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Prayer in time of affliction is under moſt promiſes to be heard: Now not to pray, not to cry to God, when we have ſo many promiſes to aſſure us of hearing, encreaſeth our ſin in the neglect of prayer. Though I do not ſay, the hypocrites prayer is under theſe promiſes of hearing, yet it ſhall be reckoned as a
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:48335:139"/> ſin that he ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>h not prayed in affliction, becauſe there are ſo many promiſes of hearing prayer in affliction. The Lord is very graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to thoſe tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> cry in affliction, and the hypocrite hath often heard that he will be ſo; how wretchedly ſin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ul is he then againſt God, as well as regardleſs of his own good, it God hear not of him, or from him, in his affliction! (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.17.) <hi>He will regard the prayer of the deſtitute, and not deſpiſe their prayer,</hi> that is, graciouſly accept and anſwer it. Again (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.33.) <hi>The Lord heareth the poor, and deſpiſeth not his Priſoners;</hi> that is, any who are bound in affliction: For I ſuppoſe that Text is not to be reſtrained to thoſe only, who are ſhut up in priſons, but takes in all thoſe that are bound in any trouble. In which ſenſe the word is uſed (<hi>Lam.</hi> 3.34.) <hi>The Lord doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men, to cruſh under his feet all the Priſoners of the earth:</hi> The Hebrew is, <hi>All the bound of the earth;</hi> by whom, he means, as chiefly the <hi>Jewes</hi> gone into Captivity, who were more properly bound, ſo any detained under any calamity whatſoever; to all, or any of them, that Scripture is applyable, <hi>The Lord doth not willingly affl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ct.</hi> Seeing then there are ſo many promiſes made to thoſe that cry in affliction, this will be urged upon the hypocrite as an heightning of his naglect, that he hath not cryed when God bound him. Thus we ſee the ſecond part of theſe hypocrites mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, by what they do not, <hi>They cry not when he bindeth them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third thing by which the woful miſery of hypocrites <hi>in heart</hi> is ſet forth, is by what they ſuffer.</p>

                     <hi>They dye in a Tempeſt, or in a Storm.</hi> One of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors gives it thus, <hi>They ſhall dye with a ſtroaker ſhaking;</hi> that
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:48335:139"/> is, they ſhall periſh by the force and violence of that affliction, which hath arreſted and taken hold of them.</p>
                  <p>But I conceive our reading is clear, <hi>They dye in Youth,</hi> becauſe Youth is the moſt ſtirring time of our life, or that time of life, wherein we uſe the moſt violent motions without, and are ſubject to the moſt violent paſſions within; therefore the Hebrew ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth both by one word. Now when we ſay, <hi>They dye in Youth,</hi> the meaning is, they dye in the prime, in the beſt, in the moſt flouriſhing time of their life, in the ſpring of their dayes.</p>
                  <p>But is it true, that all hypocrites in heart dye in youth? Do not many, who diſcover themſelves to be but hypocrites, dye in old age?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Such-like Scriptures do not intend an univerſality, as to every individual; but only ſhew that 'tis ſo for the moſt part, or often ſo. Hypocrites in heart, men of prophane ſpirits, uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dye in their youth, and are cut off in the Flower of their Age. They who multiply their ſins, ſubſtract from their dayes; and they have leaſt g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ound of hope to live long, who live ill. As bloody, ſo <hi>deceitful men</hi> (ſuch are hypocrites in heart) <hi>ſhall not live out half their dayes.</hi> They who live not out half their dayes, dye in youth. That alſo is the meaning of <hi>Eliphaz (Chap.</hi> 15.32.) where he ſaith, The wicked man ſhall have his recompence <hi>before his time;</hi> as alſo when he ſaith (<hi>Chap.</hi> 22.16.) <hi>They were cut down out of time;</hi> that is, before the ordinary time of cutting man down by Death was come. And therefore, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>they die in youth,</hi> needs not be taken in that ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as importing that they die before they come to mens eſtate, but only that they die before the common time of dying. To die in youth ſignifieth any immature death; or when death cometh ſuddainly upon any, they may be ſaid to die in youth. Thus here; <hi>they die in youth,</hi> that is, ſome immature or ſuddain death over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes them, they come to an haſty or untimely end, they prolong not their dayes on earth.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this dying in youth may refer to the hypocrites un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preparedneſs or unfitneſs to die. Unprepared perſons may be ſaid to die in youth, becauſe youths or younger men a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="270" facs="tcp:48335:140"/> of thy youth.</hi> Young men are commonly ſo unprepared to die, that whoſoever die unprepared, may be ſaid to die in youth; yea, though they die in old age, <hi>they die infants.</hi> I may ſay at leaſt in aluſion to that of the Prophet (poſſibly it may be a proof of what I ſay) <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.20.) <hi>An old man that hath not filled his dayes</hi> (by being good and doing good) <hi>dieth a child.</hi> As a <hi>child may be ſaid to die an hundred years old,</hi> when he dies full of grace, ſo a man of an hundred years old, may be ſaid to die a child, an infant, when he hath no grace; for though he hath been long in the world, yet he can hardly be ſaid to have lived at all.

                  <p>They who live like the wicked ſhall dy like the wicked, and live with them, if theirs may be called a life, for evermore. The hypocrite, with all his varniſh and fair colours, ſhall not die like a godly man, nor live with him after death; though he hath lived the life of a godly man, as to appearance, yet he ſhal not die ſo, nor live ſo when the dead riſe: he ſhal die and live like and among his own company, the unclean. He was ſecretly unclean in his life, and he ſhall openly live among the unclean, when he dyes. <hi>Balaam</hi> a Sorcerer, a Witch, a falſe Prophet, how did he beg, <hi>that he might die the death of the righteous, and that his laſt end might be like his! (Num.</hi> 23.14.) The hypocrite would ſain die like thoſe whom he hath imitated and made a ſhew of all the dayes of his life; But did <hi>Balaam</hi> dy like the righteous? no, he dyed, as he lived, like one that had loved the wages of unrighteouſneſs. Though hypocrites have lived in reputation with godly and good men, yea, have been reputed godly and good men, yet when they die they ſhal go down among the unclean, even among the debauched and filthy Sodom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites, they ſhal go to their own place and to their own company.

What place is congenial to, what place is the center of wicked men? Surely Hell, the bottomleſs pit is their own place, and that's the meaning of the text there. <hi>Judas</hi> was a great while among the Apoſtles in an high place, in a very excellent
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:48335:141"/> place, he went like an Apoſtle, or for an Apoſtle; but that was not his <hi>owne place;</hi> he was an hypocrite, and when he dyed then he went to his owne place, to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

If it were poſſible, all the godly or ſincere ſhould be in one place as to ſpirituals here (that's moſt comely and deſirable, though not attainable) yet we cannot make the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration perfect in this life; but at death it will be done perfectly; death will not leave one hypocrite among the ſincere, not a weed among the herbs, nor a chaff in the floor; death will make perfect ſeparation; after death all the holy ſhall be gathered together in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one ſociety, and all the unholy into another ſociety by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.

                  <p>Firſt, that he might raiſe ſome hope in <hi>Job,</hi> if he did it laſt humble himſelf, he repeats the gracious dealings of God with humble and upright-hearted ones at the 15th verſe; I ſay he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peats it, becauſe he had ſpoken of it before (<hi>verſ.</hi> 6, 7.) and this is a very uſeful and profitable repetition, by which <hi>Job</hi> is doubly admoniſhed to raiſe himſelf from his deſpair of a better condition; foraſmuch as God doth not afflict with a purpoſe to deſtroy, but that he may heal and help the afflicted.

                  <p>The word notes, extream oppreſſion; we read it (<hi>Num.</hi> 22.25.) in the ſtory of <hi>Balaam,</hi> where 'tis ſaid, his Aſſe cruſhed (or preſſed, or oppreſſed) his foot againſt the wall, while he was going to curſe the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that ſo <hi>Balak</hi> might oppreſſe them.

Oppreſſion takes faſt hold. The Lord takes faſt hold of ſinners by oppreſſion, and will not let them go till he hath opened their ears; but as ſoon as he hath opened their ears in or by their oppreſſions, then (out of hand) he delivereth them in, if not out of their afflictions. From the connection of this with the former part of the <hi>verſe,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerve;
<q>The evil of oppreſſion or trouble is preparatory to, or a uſual meanes to fit us for our receiving of good.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He delivereth them in affliction, when he hath opened their ears in or by oppreſſion. When once the ſoul by hearing the cry of the oppreſſor is made obedient to the call of God, then God comes and workes deliverance. Good men, while free from evil, are oftentimes like the wilde aſs deſcribed in the 39th chapter of this book, ſuch as will not hear nor regard the crying of the driver, though he be not an exactor, (as the word there ſignifies and we put in the Margine) but a fair and gentle driver.

                     <hi>Elihu</hi> having laid down this general Doctrine, makes Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it in the two verſes following;
<q>
                        <bibl>

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Elihu</hi> proceeds from the general <hi>Theſis</hi> or aſſertion of Gods deliverance, to the <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> accommodating the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to <hi>Jobs</hi> Caſe and Perſon, <hi>Even ſo he would have remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved thee,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>This 16th verſe contains the firſt part of the Application made to <hi>Job,</hi> where <hi>Elihu</hi> informs him what the iſſue would undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly have been, if he had ſubmitted (which he did not) as he ought, to the afflicting hand of God, and had not (which he did and ought not) filled his mouth and the eare of God with bitter complaints, nor ſtood ſo ſtifflly upon his own defence and vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. This <hi>Elihu</hi> doth by a double alluſion.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, to the bringing of a man out of cloſe priſon into a ſtate of freedom, or into an open air. This he gives us in the former part of the verſe, <hi>even ſo would he have removed thee out of the ſtrait into a broad place.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, he doth it by alluding to the furniſhing of a mans table with ſtore, not only of wholſome but of delicious meates, who before fared very hardly. This he doth in the cloſe of the verſe, <hi>and that which ſhould be ſet on thy table, ſhould be full of fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> As if he had ſaid, <hi>if thou had'ſt harkened to the voyce of God, thou ſhould'ſt have had both liberty, and plenty, had'ſt thou been bettered by thy troubles, it had been better for thee, and much better with thee; thou hadſt been enlarged fully, thou hadſt been ſupplyed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly with all manner of good things deſirable, even to the utmoſt of thy deſires:</hi> that's the general ſcope of this verſe; more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Even ſo would he have removed thee out of a ſtrait into a broad place.</hi> Some read the verſe with a retro-reſpect, or as looking back to the time paſt; as if <hi>Elihu</hi> had bid <hi>Job</hi> remember his former expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences, whether God heretofore dealt not bountifully with him.

                  <p>Secondly, From the Alluſion, Note;
<q>Troubles are ſtreights.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He is in a ſtreight, that knows not what to do; thus 'tis often with us in our troubles. It was ſo with good <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> (2 Chro. 20 12.) when a mighty Enemy came up againſt him, <hi>Lord</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>we know not what to do, but our eyes are towards thee;</hi> he was in a ſtreight, what to do here on earth, but he had a b oad place to look to, even to heaven, to the Lord of heaven and earth, <hi>our eyes are towards thee.</hi> As if he had ſaid, <hi>Lord we are in a ſtreight, but thou art never in ſtreights; Lord counſel us what to do, Lord help us to do it.</hi> The afflicted, many a time, <hi>know not what to do,</hi> and many times, they cannot do what they know; they know this thing would do them good, but they cannot do it, they know, that might be helpfull to them, but they cannot reach it.</p>
                  <p>He is in a ſtreight that doubts what good to chuſe, much more is he in a ſtreight who ſeeth that what-ever he chuſeth, he muſt
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:48335:146"/> chuſe ſome evil. <hi>Paul</hi> was in the former ſtreight, and <hi>David</hi> in the latter: <hi>Paul</hi> was in a ſtreight, it was a trouble to him, being doubtfull, which good to chuſe, (<hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23.) <hi>I am in a ſtreight betwixt two;</hi> betwixt what two? betwixt two very good things, namely, living here in doing good, and going to heaven to receive his reward; he was in a ſtreight whether to live here to do more work, or to go to heaven to receive the reward of his work. 'Tis ſome trouble, but a bleſſed trouble, when we are in a doubt which good to chuſe. But they are in very great trouble, who are in ſuch a ſtreight, that whatſoever they chuſe, they muſt chuſe evil: That was <hi>Davids</hi> ſtreight, (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.14.) the Lord gave him a choyce, and a very ſad one, of three evils, either of famine, or of peſtilence, or of flying and falling before his Enemies; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>I am in a great ſtreight;</hi> ſomewhat he muſt chuſe, and what-ever he choſe, it was evil, that is, penal evil; but ſeeing it was ſo, and could not be otherwiſe, <hi>(e malis mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum)</hi> he would chuſe the leaſt, he choſe to fall into the hand of God, rather than into the hands of men. Into ſuch kind of ſtreights are the people of God ſometimes caſt, they have ſomewhat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them to chuſe, but what-ever they chuſe, it is very hard, and troubleſome; troubleſome to ſtay, and troubleſome to go, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome to abide by it, and troubleſome to flie from it, every way it is a trouble; and how many of the precious people of God have been brought into theſe troubles! Only this is their comfort as well as their duty, that though they may be in ſuch ſtreights as neceſſitate them to chuſe a leſs good, or a penal evil, yet as God will not, ſo man cannot bring them into any ſuch ſtreights as neceſſitate them to chuſe a moral or ſinful evil. Troubles are ſtreights. <hi>He would have removed thee out of a ſtreight into a broad place.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Note, Thirdly;
<q>What-ever ſtreights we are in, God is able to inlarge us.</q>

                  <p>This is the firſt part of the Application, wherein <hi>Elihu</hi> acquaints <hi>Job</hi> what God would have done for him, if he had carried it humbly (as he ſhould) under his afflicting hand, he had been out of his fetters and bonds before that time, and ſet in a large place, he had not fed ſo long upon aſhes, his Table had <hi>been full of fatneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As in this verſe <hi>Elihu</hi> applyed the matter to <hi>Job,</hi> by ſhewing him how it ſhould have fared with him, or how graciouſly and bountifully God would have dealt with him, if he had humbled himſelf, as he ought, and been duly affected with the afflicting hand then upon him, ſo in the following verſe, he applyeth the Doctrine to him, by telling him, that the reaſon why he was at the preſent in ſuch an afflicted condition, was, becauſe he had not ſo humbled himſelf in his affliction.</p>

                     </note> Secondly, That in his Magiſtratical capacity, or that being a Magiſtrate, he <hi>had fulfilled the Judgment of the wicked;</hi> that is, what wicked men, and their bad Cauſes wanted of weight and t uth, of righteouſneſs and goodneſs, that he filled up by favour, by accepting their perſons, and giving countenance to their wickedneſs.

                     </gap>ged him with much ſin in his carriage under his afflictions; and it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that <hi>Job</hi> heard <hi>Elihu</hi> more patiently and equally than he heard his friends, becauſe <hi>Elihu</hi> dealt more equally and candidly with him, than his F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iends did; he did not lay it upon him, as if in the foregoing part of his life he had traded in wickedneſs; but only reproved him for his boldneſs, in dealing with, and appealing ſo often unto God, in his ſoars and ſickneſs; or, becauſe his ſpirit was not broken enough, notwithſtanding thoſe ſore breakings and ſickneſſes, with which he was afflicted. So then, <hi>Elihu</hi> in ſaying this, intended not that <hi>Job had fulfilled the Judgment of the wicked,</hi> either by a wicked converſation, or by perverting Juſtice in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the wicked: Such a charge had been utterly inconſiſtent with the Teſtimony which God gave of him in the firſt Chapter of this Book.</p>
                  <p>Therefore Secondly, <hi>Thou haſt fulfilled the judgement of the wicked,</hi> may be underſtood, firſt, that <hi>Job</hi> had gone near, in his behaviour under his affliction, to do even almoſt as Satan boaſted, and preſumed to God he would do, in the ſecond Chapter, that if God did but lay his hand home or cloſer upon him, and touch his bone and his fleſh, then (ſaid Satan) <hi>he will curſe thee to thy face.</hi> Now, though <hi>Job</hi> did never, in the height, fulfill this wicked opinion or judgement of the Devil concerning him, yet by his often complainings of, and murmurings about the ſevere dealings of God with him, and his not pittying him in his diſtreſs, he verged upon it, he came ſomewhat towards, and much too near
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:48335:150"/> the fulfilling of that judgement of the wicked one; and <hi>Elihu</hi> might ſay, <hi>Thou haſt fulfilled the judgement of the wicked,</hi> thou haſt done (in a degree or ſhew) as the Devil ſaid thou wouldſt, if the hand of God were heavy upon thy body.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Theſe words, <hi>Thou haſt fulfilled the judgement of the wicked,</hi> may have this meaning, Thou haſt rendred thy ſelf guilty of, or obnoxious to, that judgement which God uſeth to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce and execute upon wicked men.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Thou haſt fulfilled the judgment of the wicked;</hi> that is, thou under the hand of God haſt carried thy ſelf as wicked men uſually do, thou haſt imitated them in a great meaſure.<note place="margin">More impiorum cauſam tuam a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſti impaticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter contra de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um murmuran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do. <hi>Sanct.</hi>
                     </note> What do wicked men when the hand of God is upon them? they rage and murmur, they toyl themſelves and are full of the fury of the Lord, as a wild Bull in a net; thou ſeemeſt to have fulfilled this judgment of the wicked, for thou haſt been ſo far from humbling thy ſelf, as thou oughteſt, that thou haſt ſtood it out and ſtouted it with God, and deſired a day of hearing; Haſt thou not in all this <hi>fulfilled the judgment of the wicked?</hi> In the 34th chapter of this book at the 8th verſe, <hi>Elihu</hi> told <hi>Job, that he had gone in company with the wicked,</hi> that is, that he had taken the ſame courſe with the wicked, and as they uſe to do in the day of their calamity. And that's the meaning of <hi>Elihu</hi>'s charge here, <hi>Thou haſt fulfilled the judgement of the wicked,</hi> that is, thou haſt carried thy ſelf too too like wicked men in the day of thy trouble. Thus <hi>Job</hi> is here cenſured, not ſtrictly, as if he had done like wicked men, but becauſe he did not ſuffer ſo patiently as became a good man; this was in him a <hi>fulfilling of the judgment of the wicked.</hi>

                  <p>They that are good in their ſtate, may ſometimes in their acts, (as <hi>Job</hi> here) <hi>fulfil the judgment of the wicked.</hi> As hypocrites fulfil, in appearance, the judgment of the upright, that is, do like upright men; ſo the up<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Though we may not judge ſuch a mans eternal eſtate like that of the wicked, yet as to this or that act, we may (without breach of charity) number him among the wicked, and he may quickly feel the ſame ſmart which the wicked feel.

<pb n="293" facs="tcp:48335:151"/> of life to them that lay hold upon her.</hi> And as the believers cloſing with and hold-faſt upon Chriſt is expreſſed by this word, ſo alſo is the hold which ſin takes of an unbeliever (<hi>Prov.</hi> 5.22.) <hi>His own iniquities ſhall take the wicked himſelf, and he ſhall be holden with the cords of his ſin.

                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Note; Firſt,
<q>God will not indulge ſin in any, no not in his own ſervants.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>If a <hi>Job</hi> do like wicked men, he ſhall ſmart like the wicked. Though God will not caſt any of his ſervants to hell for ever, yet they may be caſt into a temporary hell.

                     <hi>Men oftentimes get out of the hand of man's justice, they can break priſon, they can file off their fetters and cast their cords from them;</hi> but none can break Gods priſon, none can get out of the hands of divine Juſtice. As Juſtice and Judgement ſhall take hold of, attach and arreſt ſinners, ſo they will hold them faſt, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make an eſcape, nor can any reſcue them till God ſignes a warrant for their releaſe. We cannot hinder God in the exerciſe or execution of Juſtice, nor turn him aſide from his purpoſe, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by our power or pollicies. God can eaſily hinder men of their purpoſes, and can undo what-ever they have done, but none can make the Juſtice and Judgment of God let go their hold. Therefore let us take heed, while we hold ſin and iniquity, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hing can deliver us from the hand, or hold off the ſin-chaſtning and avenging hand of God. However men fail, the Juſtice and Judgment of God are everlaſting; they hold on their courſe ſtill though men do not. Though we could pluck the Sun out of the firmament, yet not Juſtice out of the hand of God. We can neither put God beſides his rule, nor force him from his purpoſe. Theſe are the two great Prerogatives of God, he hath firſt a righteouſneſs which cannot be perverted; ſecondly, a Juſtice which cannot be interrupted.</p>

That we have in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of the 19th verſe, <hi>nor all the forces of ſtrength;</hi> though thou haſt armies, millions of men in armes, yea though thou haſt legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:48335:153"/> of Angels in pay, yet they cannot prevail, all <hi>the forces of ſtrength</hi> cannot deliver thee.</p>
                  <p>There is alſo a third conſideration, to ſhew the unavoidable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the wrath of God, namely, becauſe there is no ſleeing no making an eſcape from it. Some indeed are ſo angry that you cannot ſatisfy them with a ranſom, and ſo powerful that no ſtrength can deliver you from their power, yet poſſibly you may make an eſcape and hide from them, you may get out of the way and lye out of ſight; but ſaith <hi>Elihu,</hi> that will not do neither in this caſe, (v. 20.) <hi>deſire not the night when people are cut off in their place;</hi> the night or darkneſs will be no cover to thee from the wrath of an angry God. Thus you have the ſum and ſubſtance of this admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>Job, Beware, becauſe there is wrath,</hi> and that wrath of God ſo terrible that nothing can deliver from it, no ranſom, no power, nor can we deliver our ſelves by flight, or by darkneſs.</p>

                  <p>The word which we tranſlate <hi>wrath,</hi> comes from a root that ſignifies <hi>heat,</hi> or to <hi>be hot;</hi> and we know they that are angry and in wrath are very hot, their mind and ſpirit are enflamed, we uſe to ſay to an angry man, <hi>why are you ſo hot:</hi> the wrath of man is hot: the wrath of God, is certainly much hotter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Becauſe there is wrath;</hi> but where is it? I anſwer, Firſt, there is wrath, in the breaſt or heart of God, there his anger is kindled againſt ſinners. Secondly, There is wrath in the decree of God, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſinners (<hi>Zeph.</hi> 2.2.) Thirdly, there is wrath in the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of God, there it firſt appeares and breaketh forth (<hi>Deut.</hi> 29.20.) So the Apoſtle (<hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18.) <hi>The wrath of God is reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from heaven.</hi> How is it revealed? As his love is revealed in promiſes, ſo his wrath in threatnings. Fourthly, there is wrath in the works of God, in his Judgments acted upon the children of men. As there is wrath hidden in his breaſt and decreed, ſo wrath is heard from his mouth in terrible threatnings, and ſeen in his hand by terrible Judgments executed upon his enemies. We may ſee wrath in the dealings of God; his works tell us he is angry. Therefore fear to perſiſt, leſt in his anger he take thee quite away. We ſhould beware of ſinful works, leſt we provoke and ſtir up the Lords anger to make bloody work. <hi>There is wrath,</hi> (particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:48335:153"/> as to the dealings of God with thee, <hi>O Job,</hi> ſaith <hi>Elihu</hi>) therefore,

                     </gap>al, to make up and clear the ſence of this verſe. We have a like reading in the 36<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Iſaiah, v.</hi> 18. <hi>Beware leſt Hezekiah perſwade you,</hi> &amp;c. The word <hi>beware,</hi> is a ſupplement added there in a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent character, to ſhew that it is not expreſſed in the Hebrew. As if <hi>Raoſhakeh</hi> had ſaid, If <hi>Hezekiah</hi> perſwade you to ſtand out againſt my Maſter <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> you will provoke his wrath to your utter ruine and deſtruction, therefore <hi>beware.</hi> There, as here, <hi>beware,</hi> beſpeakes our caution; becauſe there is wrath, take heed what you do or ſay.</p>
                  <p>Hence note, Firſt;
<q>There is a wrath of God againſt ſin, or, God will appear in wrath againſt ſinners.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle (<hi>Chap.</hi> 4.8.) tells us in a direct predication, <hi>God is love;</hi> and 'tis as true, <hi>God is wrath.</hi> The wrath of God is a divine perfection, it is the perfection of God, as his love is. God is one and the ſame, he is not divided into ſeveral paſſions, perturbations or affections; but thus the Scripture ſpeaks of him, to denote what we may expect from him, and what he is and will be in his actings towards them who obey him not.</p>
                  <p>Secondly note;
<q>The wrath of God appears and is put forth in his works of judgment.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As the goodneſs of God is his love acted, or as the good things which God doth for us are love-actions, ſo the evils that are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us are wrath-actions. I do not ſay that every evil which we endure in this world is the acting of wrath upon us, but I ſay, there is wrath in the actings of evil upon us. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid to <hi>Aaron, (Numb.</hi> 16.46.) <hi>Go quickly, take a Cenſer</hi> (haſt, haſt) <hi>and make an atonement, there is wrath gone out.</hi> How did he know wrath was gone out? He tells us in the next words, <hi>the plague is
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:48335:154"/> begun:</hi> He ſaw wrath in that diſpenſation of God; the plague be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun argued that God was angry. <hi>Becauſe there is wrath, beware.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note, Thirdly;
<q>We ſhould by all meanes take heed and beware of the wrath of God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The wrath of man is a ſmall matter to the wrath of God, yet we are very careful to beware of the wrath of man, eſpecially of great men. The wrath of the Kings and Princes of the world, is like the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

(Pſal.</hi> 90.11.) We may take ſome ſcantling, ſome meaſure of the wrath of man, and know how far it can go, and what it can do; but we can take no meaſure of the wrath of God, for it is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable, and therefore we ſhould avoid every thing that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures his wrath. That's the meaning of this caveat; do nothing that blowes up or incenſes the wrath of God. But what is it that blowes up wrath? It is ſin, every ſin hath that in it which may blow up wrath. The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The wrath of God is revealed from heaven, againſt all ungodlineſs and unrighteouſneſs of men,</hi> not only againſt this or that ungodlineſs, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And as we ſhould do nothing to provoke wrath, ſo we ſhould do every thing which may prevent wrath (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.12.) <hi>Kiſs the Son,</hi> why? <hi>leſt he be angry, and his wrath kindle.</hi> Who is the Son, and what's this kiſſing of the Son which p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> that believes not, <hi>the wrath of God abideth on him, (Johs</hi> 3.36.) Jeſus Chriſt alone is he which delivereth us from the wra h to come, (1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.10.) And if we further conſider this wrath from the expreſſion, both of the Pſalm and of the Text, it ſhould make us (who are ſo fearful of, and who ſo ſhift from the wrath of men) exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly afraid of the wrath of God. The word, as was ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, comes from a root which ſignifieth the heat of fire, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying that the wrath of God is fire, and (<hi>Heb.</hi> 10.27.) it is called <hi>fiery indignation;</hi> yea, God himſelf (<hi>Heb.</hi> 12.29.) is called <hi>a conſuming fire.</hi> Why doth the Scripture expreſs him and his wrath, by fire? Surely becauſe fire is well known to us, and we are well able to conceive how dreadful a thing fire is, when it is in its rage and fury, when it hath got the maſtery; <hi>Fire is a comfortable ſervant, but a dreadful master.</hi> Now as fire is the moſt dreadful element, ſo wrath is the moſt dreadful attribute of God; yet I may ſay, that elementary fire which (as to our ſence) is ſo dreadful, is but a ſun-ſhine compared to the wrath of God; as will appear if we conſider it in two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it burns internally. The viſible fire burns but viſible things, outward things, but this fire burns within, ſcorches the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, burns the ſoul, burns that which all the fires in the world cannot reach, cannot touch. God is a Spirit, and the wrath of God is a fire that burnes the ſpirits, and will for ever afflict and torment the conſciences of wicked men. The hotteſt fires which the moſt enraged malitious Perſecuters kindle, cannot touch the ſpirit; the conſcience is quiet, the ſoul triumphs while the fleſh fries in the fire. 'Tis the fire of divine wrath alone which hath power upon the ſoul; and a burning there is ten thouſand times more painful than the burning of our fleſh.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the wrath of God burns eternally. Your fires here though they are dreadful, yet they go out, they conſume them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by conſuming the matter or fuel caſt into them; they cannot continue alwayes, becauſe they eat up and devour that which maintaines them: But the wrath of God burns continually. God is called a conſuming fire, not becauſe the fire of his wra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h conſumes, but becauſe he conſumeth ſinners in the fire of wrath;
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:48335:155"/> and when we ſay, he conſumeth ſinners in his wrath, or his wrath conſumeth ſinners, we are not to underſtand it of a conſumption as to <hi>being,</hi> but only as to a <hi>well or comfortabe being;</hi> for not only the ſoul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, but the very bodies of ſinners ſhall remain in this fire of the wrath of God for ever unconſumed. The bodies of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſhall be raiſed again at the great day, and being re-united to their ſouls, both ſhal abide unconſumed in the fire of this conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wrath eternally. The great dread of ordinary fire is, that it conſumes what it burns, but the greateſt dread of this fire is, that it conſumes not that which it burns. O therefore take heed of the wrath of God, the wrath of God is terrible as to corporal and temporal judgements, much more as to ſpirituall and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal judgments; that is, as the fire of his wrath burns both inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally and eternally. <hi>Becauſe there is wrath, beware,</hi>
                     <q>Leſt he take thee away with his ſtroke.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here the danger is expreſt. If the Lord be angry, he can ſoon take thee away with a ſtroke, he can remove, yea <hi>hurry</hi> thee away out of all thy preſent joys and enjoyments, to everlaſting ſorrows.

                  <p>He can take the ſtrongeſt away with a ſtroke, he can do it wi h one ſtroke. The Lord needs not ſtand cutting and ſlaſhing, hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:48335:155"/> and hewing (as we ſay) all day long; one ſtroke of his will do it. He took away <hi>Herod</hi> at one ſtroke (<hi>Acts</hi> 12.23.) He took away <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> at one ſtroke (<hi>Acts</hi> 5.5.) <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> were taken away with one ſtroke (<hi>Lev.</hi> 10.1.)

The Lord ſtrikes ſome to take away their ſin; thus he ſtrikes his own people: others he ſtrikes to take away their perſons; thus he ſtrikes the wicked, eſpecially thoſe who enemy-like, deſignedly ſtrike at Him, his Name, his Truth, his Glory. <hi>Elihu</hi> doth not ſay, <hi>Beware leaſt he ſtrike thee,</hi> but <hi>least he take thee away with a ſtroke.</hi> The Lord often ſtrikes his own faithful ſervants, they receive many a ſtroke, many a laſh, many a blow, many a chaſtiſement at his hands, but he doth not take them away with a ſtroke, as he doth the wicked. The Lord ſtrikes his ſervants to take away their ſins, and he ſtrikes wicked men to take away their lives, to deſtroy them utterly.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As the word ſignifieth taking away with clapping <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Note;
<q>God will even laugh at the ruine of wicked men,</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He will clap his hands at their fall. We read (<hi>Prov.</hi> 1.26, 27.) how Wiſdome called and cried, and none would anſwer, all ſet her calls and counſels at naught; what followed? <hi>I</hi> (ſaid Wiſdome, that is, Chriſt) <hi>will laugh at their calamity, and mock when their fear cometh;</hi> as much as is ſaid in the Text, I will take them away with a ſtroke, or with clapping my hands, with a kind of deriding <hi>plaudite</hi> at their going off, or rather at their being thruſt off the Stage of this world. They are in the moſt ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, whom God not only deſtroys, but derides; they have moſt cauſe to mourn in their affliction, at whoſe affliction God
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:48335:156"/> laughs. It is ſaid (<hi>Job</hi> 9.23.) <hi>God will laugh at the tryal</hi> of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, and why, was ſhewed in opening that place; I only touch it now upon this occaſion: The Lord knows the innocent will come off with honour, will ſtand it out in their tryal bravely, he ſees what Courage &amp; Faith &amp; Patience they will manifeſt in and under their ſufferings. Now as the Lord even claps his hands, and laughs, when his choſen noble ones go forth to the tryal, knowing they will honour him in their tryal; ſo the Lord laughs at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the wicked, knowing that his Juſtice and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhall have a full ſtroke at them, and lay both their ſhame and ſin open to all the world.</p>
                  <p>That the Lord in his wrath takes away with a ſtroke, ſhould make us all <hi>beware,</hi> fear and tremble; but that which followeth, may make us wary, fear and tremble much more; for, ſaith <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hu</hi> in the cloſe of the verſe,

But here is a Caſe wherein no Ranſome will be taken, no, though it be, not a ſmall, petty Ranſome, but a <hi>great Ranſome,</hi> of that (ſaith <hi>Elihu</hi>) it <hi>cannot deliver thee.</hi> As if he had ſaid, When once God is ſo far provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, that the Decree is gone forth to deſtroy thee, then it will be in vain to think of getting off by Ranſome.</p>
                  <p>Here it may be queried, What is this great Ranſom that will not deliver? There is a twofold Ranſome, by one of which the people of God are ſomtimes delivered, and alwayes by the other.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The people of God are ſomtimes ranſomed or delivered by the deſtruction and ruine of the wicked; that's their Ranſom, and that, not ſeldom, proves a great Ranſome. It is ſaid ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly (Prov. 21.18.) <hi>The wicked ſhall be a Ranſome for the righteous;</hi> how, a Ranſome for the righteous! will a wicked man p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> doth every man right: but for a good man, that is, for a man that hath been very kind and bountiful to others, ſome <hi>would even dare to dye;</hi> yet he that doth ſo, muſt be ſuppoſed to be a righteous and a good man himſelf. For it cannot be thought that a wicked man would give himſelf a Ranſome for the righteous, that he would dye for him whom he doth not love, yea, whom he uſually hates to the death. How then is it affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Solomon,</hi> that the wicked ſhall be a Ranſome for the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous? The meaning is, God will deſtroy the wicked, to ſave the righteous, or he will ſave the righteous, even through the blood and deſtruction of the wicked: In that ſence the wicked are many times a Ranſome for the righteous, rather than the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſhall periſh, the Lord will deſtroy the wicked. Thus the Lord ſpake by his Prophet of old (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.3.) <hi>I gave Egypt for thy Ranſome, Ethispia and Sheba for thee.</hi> How was <hi>Egypt</hi> a Ranſome for <hi>Iſrael?</hi> had they any mind to deliver the people of God? no; but rather than God would not have <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſaved, he deſtroyed <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians</hi> in the Red Sea. Thus the Lord makes the wicked a Ranſome for the righteous. Though <hi>Egypt</hi> were a very goodly Country, yet God deſtroyed it by ten Plagues, that he might deliver <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Though <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was a great Prince, he drowned him in the Sea, rather than his people ſhould go back into Captivity. <hi>Solomon</hi> gives us this ſenſe of the Prophets words fully in his own (<hi>Prov.</hi> 11.8.) <hi>The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I anſwer, Firſt, in general; it is any thing on this ſide Chriſt, be it what it will. The greateſt Ran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Thirdly, It is not our own good works, no not our own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. Fourthly, It is not any of the good works or righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of any other, the holyeſt men on earth, no not the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Saints and holy Angels in Heaven, that can deliver us from the wrath of God. The firſt of theſe particulars <hi>Elihu</hi> gives for inſtance in the 19th verſe (of which I ſhall there ſpeak further) and we may underſtand this verſe of all the reſt. <hi>Then a great Ranſome cannot deliver thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>There is nothing but the Blood of Chriſt can ranſome ſinners from the wrath of God, nor will that deliver ſome ſinners.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>(I ſuppoſe <hi>Elihu</hi> might have reſpect to that, in urging <hi>Job</hi> to humble himſelf and repent) There are Caſes, wherein even the Blood of Chriſt will not deliver; though that hath an intrinſecal vertue, power, and value, to deliver any ſinner, yet, I ſay, there are Caſes, wherein even that great Ranſome, the Blood of Chriſt, will not deliver ſinners; or thus, there are many ſinners in ſuch a Caſe, that Chriſt will not ranſome them by his Blood. But who are they?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, All that are impenitent, and perſiſt obſtinately in their ſins. If any man reſolve to go on in ſin, the Blood of Chriſt is no Ranſome for him. Jeſus Chriſt came to ſave us from our ſins, not to ſave us in our ſins.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, All that are unbelievers; though they have a great meaſure of ſorrow (ſuch as it is) for ſin, yea, ſuppoſe they have left off the outward practiſe of thoſe ſins, for which they have ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed, yet if they do not lay hold on Chriſt by faith, his Blood is no Ranſome for them. As Chriſt will not ſave preſumptuous ſinners, who believe without repenting, ſo neither will he ſave in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulous ſinners, who repent without believing. Thirdly, That great price of the Blood of Chriſt is not a Ranſome for apoſtatiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Such Apoſtates <hi>crucifie to themſelves the Son of God afreſh, and</hi> (by their being aſhamed of him, and turning from him, as much as in them lyes) <hi>put him to open ſhame,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks (<hi>Heb.</hi> 6.6.) but God will never crucifie his Son afreſh, nor put him again to open ſhame, for the ranſoming of wilful Apoſtates. It is the ground of our hope, that God once gave up his Son to be crucified for us, but they are of all men moſt hopeleſs, who crucifie to themſelves the Son of God afreſh. The Son of God, Jeſus Chriſt, will not ſave <hi>thoſe that tread him under foot,</hi> not ſhall <hi>the Blood of the Covenant</hi> be a Ranſom for <hi>thoſe who count it an unholy thing;</hi> as 'tis ſaid at the 29th verſe. They who refuſe the Goſpel, that is, Goſpel-Grace, ſhall never have any benefit by the Goſpel; theſe Apoſtates do not only refuſe to chuſe the Grace of the Goſpel, but refuſe it after a ſeeming choyce of it, and are therefore ſaid in the cloſe of that verſe, <hi>to have done deſpite to the Spirit of Grace;</hi> and ſhall they who deſpiſe, and, which is more, do deſpite to the Spirit of Grace, be ranſom'd through Grace? Thus we ſee, that as nothing but the Blood of Chriſt can be a Ranſome, ſo ſome ſhall have no ſhare in, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by that great Ranſome.

They who never made the Lord their choyce in good times, will yet make him their refuge in evil times, or in dayes of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; they think ſurely to be ſheltered, and ſaved, and ſpared, when they pray: but this will not do neither; <hi>Will he eſteem thy prayers?</hi> The Hebrew Text, at leaſt, allows, if not clearly holds

So then, when the Lords wrath appears, neither riches, nor ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, nor prayers, nor teares can give ſinners any relief.

The Lord having declared how reſolv'd he was to proceed in a way of wrath againſt the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, adds (<hi>Jer.</hi> 14.12.) <hi>When they faſt I will not hear their cry.</hi> That people had been very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate and rebellious, they had withſtood the call of God by the Prophet; yet when they ſaw wrath appearing and approaching, then they betook themſelves to faſting and prayer; but ſaith the Lord, it ſhall not advantage them, though they faſt and in their faſting cry, yet I will not regard them, nor be entreated: I know they will be praying to me, but I will take no notice of them. See how dreadfull a thing it is to refuſe the offers and tenders of grace, to go on in a way of ſin; for then, no ranſome will do it, riches and honours, yea prayers and cryes and teares, ſhall not be regarded. <hi>Will he eſteem thy riches?</hi>

                  <p>This is to be joyned (according to our tranſlation) with the former words, and it ſuits fully with our tranſlation of theſe words; Gold being the beſt of worldly riches, and having the greateſt power with and command over men; yet ſaith <hi>Elihu, Will he eſteem thy riches, no not Gold.</hi> He mentions that, becauſe (I ſay) it is the choiceſt part of riches, the worſt ſort of gold is of higher eſteem and worth, than any other mettal; Gold bea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Not only will he not eſteem your Copper, and Braſſe, and Iron and Tynn, but not your Gold, (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18.) Gold doth much with men, but nothing with God. I ſhall not ſtay upon this clauſe, it being only an hightning of the ſame thing before aſſerted. But</p>

So then, as our reading complyes with the former part of the verſe, ſo this hath as faire a
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:48335:160"/> compliance with the latter; <hi>No not any defence.</hi> The word ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies <hi>to fortify,</hi> to fence, to make ſtrong, and hence, <hi>gold,</hi> becauſe gold is mans ſtrength and defence. Riches are a great ſtrength; to be rich in gold is a mans ſtrong tower. <hi>Will he esteem thy rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es? no, not gold, or defence,</hi>
                     <q>Nor all the forces of ſtrength.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe words, in the cloſe of the verſe, being the ſame with the middle part, as laſt rendred, may very well be drawn up into one, and conceived of, as if <hi>Elihu</hi> had ſaid, <hi>Suppoſe thou art a mighty man and haſt ſtrong forces, he will not eſteem thee for all that; The very weakneſs of God is ſtronger than man</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.25.) that is, than the ſtrongeſt man, or than any ſtrength which man can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, either to oppoſe God, or to protect himſelf againſt him. The Prophet to ſhew the great power of the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> ſaith (<hi>Hab.</hi> 1.10.) <hi>They ſhall ſcoff at kings, and deride every ſtrong hold.</hi> Surely the Lord is ſo far from eſteeming the defences and forces of ſtrength, which men make to, and for themſelves, that he ſcoffs at and derides them. The Lord will deride all the ſtrong holds of man, even the forces of ſtrength. Some get internal carnal ſtrong holds, to fortifie themſelves in, of which the Apoſtle ſpeaks (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4.) <hi>The weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty, through God, to the caſting down of ſtrong holds.</hi> Moſt ſinners are men of wit, they provide themſelves ſtrong holds to ſave their ſins in, they have their excuſes and reaſonings to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their ſins or themſelves in their ſins by. Others are men of might, they get external ſtrong holds, they have Armies and Cities of defence, to ſecure themſelves by; but <hi>will the Lord regard either?</hi> Not the ſtrong holds, ſet up and maintained by force of wit, <hi>no, nor all the forces of ſtrength.</hi> Though thou haſt Army upon Army, and City upon City, though thou doſt add Caſtle to Caſtle, and Fort to Fort, they are no more than paper walls before the Lord. As neither riches nor nobleneſs, ſo no power of man can ſecure man from the hand of God. Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> varieth a little from our reading, yet concurrs fully in ſenſe; <hi>No gold, nor any other thing ſhould be able to give ſound ſtrength;</hi> which himſelf expounds by this ſhort gloſs. <hi>If now thou deſpiſeſt repentance, thou ſhalt be utterly cast off.</hi> As if he had ſaid to <hi>Job,</hi> it is not thy, or any mans ſtanding out againſt God,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:48335:160"/> that will help you, your only help is in repentance and ſelf-hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling before God. <hi>Will he esteem thy riches? no, not gold, nor all the forces of ſtrength.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>There is no ſtrength against the Lord.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As <hi>there is no counſel, ſo no force of ſtrength against the Lord. Hannah</hi> ſang this truth (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.9.) <hi>By ſtrength ſhall no man prevail,</hi> that is, againſt man, if God be with him; much more is it true that by ſtrength ſhall no man prevail againſt God (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.31.) <hi>The ſtrong ſhall be tow, and the maker thereof as a ſpark;</hi> that is, as ſome expound, their Idols, whom they made their ſtrength, ſhall be as tow, that is, as the moſt combuſtible matter, eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, <hi>and the maker of it,</hi> that is, the Idol-maker, ſhall be <hi>as a ſpark.</hi> Do but blow a ſpark among tow, and what will become of it? Such are the ſtrongeſt Idols, in which men truſt, and ſuch are the mightyeſt and ſtrongeſt men before the Lord, who truſt in them. Tow or flax or hemp (after the dreſſing) is as tinder, that the leaſt ſpark will give fire to The ſtrong (Idol) ſhall be as tow, and the maker of it as a ſpark; or, which is in effect the ſame, <hi>The ſtrong</hi> (man) <hi>ſhall be tow, and that which he hath made, or</hi> (as we put in the Margin) <hi>his work,</hi> that is, his Idol, <hi>ſhall be as a ſpark,</hi> and they ſhall both burn, or periſh together. This is the ſentence of the Lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſtrong, a ſpark ſhall ſet them on fire and burn them; how then ſhall the ſtrong be able to ſtand before the Lord who is not a ſpark, but a fire, and that a conſuming fire! and therefore, I may urge <hi>Elihu's</hi> counſel to <hi>Job,</hi> upon all ſorts of men, upon thoſe eſpecially who perſiſt in any ſin, take heed, <hi>becauſe there is wrath, beware, &amp;c.</hi> or I may urge them with the Prophets dehortation (<hi>Jer.</hi> 9.23.) <hi>Let not the wiſe man glory in his wiſdome, nor the mighty man in his ſtrength, nor the rich man in his riches,</hi> for, none of theſe can help or deliver from wrath, only Jeſus Chriſt can, and it hath been ſhewed who they are to whom he will not be a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering ranſome. It may be very uſeful to conſider what negatives <hi>Elihu</hi> puts upon ſinners as to deliverance from kindled wrath; not riches, not honour, not crying, not praying, not ſtrength, not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence can deliver without turning from ſin to God, and all in Chriſt.</p>
                  <pb n="312" facs="tcp:48335:161"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Elihu</hi> having urged two arguments to make <hi>Job</hi> beware of wrath, firſt, becauſe nothing could ranſom him, God regards not riches, no not gold; ſecondly, becauſe nothing could reſcue him, all the <hi>forces of ſtrength</hi> could not defend him againſt, nor fetch him out from under the hand of God; <hi>Elihu</hi> (I ſay) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving diſpatched theſe two arguments, he in the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                     <hi>verſe</hi> gives a further, and that a third argument to move <hi>Job</hi> to take heed of wrath, becauſe, as he could neither be ranſomed nor reſcued, ſo neither could he be hid or ſheltred from the wrath of God. That is the general ſenſe of the next verſe.</p>

                  <p>The root of that word which we render <hi>deſire,</hi> ſignifies a very earneſt breathing and longing after a thing, as conceiving and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the enjoyment thereof would be an exceeding comfort and refreſhment to us.<note place="margin">

                     </note> So 'tis uſed in the ſeventh Chapter of this book at the ſecond verſe; <hi>as the ſervant earneſtly deſireth the ſhadow,</hi> &amp;c. When a labourer is hot and ſweltered almoſt (as we ſay) at his work in the Sun, how earneſtly doth he deſire the ſhadow! We ſay (in the Margine of that place) <hi>he gapeth after the ſhadow.</hi> A man, when he is hot, gapes to ſuck in freſh air. Such an intendment and force there is in this word, <hi>deſire not,</hi> long not for, gape not after
<q>the night,</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The night ſeems not to be a thing, or a ſeaſon ſo deſireable, that we ſhould gape for it or long after it. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith (<hi>Eccl.</hi> 11.7.) <hi>Surely light is pleaſant, and it is a comfortable thing for the eyes to behold the Sun;</hi> but who hath a deſire after the night? what is the beauty or comelineſs of the night that any ſhould ſo much deſire it? why then doth <hi>Elihu</hi> here forbid <hi>Job</hi> (as ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing he did) to deſire it? <hi>deſire not the night.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, the night may be taken two wayes, or under a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold notion. Firſt properly, as that which caſteth a vail or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of darkneſs over both perſons and things, and covers them from our ſight; in alluſion to which, the ſenſe is this; Do not hope to hide or conceal thy ſelf from the eye or knowledge of God. As thou canſt not be ranſomed, as thou canſt not be reſcued from
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:48335:161"/> his power (which was ſhewed before) ſo deſire not the night, for thou canſt not be obſcured from his knowledge under the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert of it, there is no hiding from God. Though I judge that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation too groſs, which ſuppoſeth <hi>Elihu</hi> counſelling <hi>Job</hi> not to deſire the night, as robbers and adultere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Secondly, the night in Scripture, as alſo in humane Authors, is put improperly for death. All the dead are wrapt up in a night of darkneſs. Hence that counſel (<hi>John</hi> 9.4.) <hi>Work while you have the day, the night cometh when no man can work.</hi> We may work, yea, much work is done in the natural night. It is ſaid of the vertuous woman (<hi>Prov.</hi> 31.18.) <hi>Her candle goes not out by night;</hi> ſhe and her maids are at work in the night; therefore it cannot be ſtrictly meant, that no man can work in the night. The night there is the night of death,<note place="margin">Ne aſpires ad illam noctem <hi>(ſc. mortis)</hi> qua abeunt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puli ad locum ſuum. <hi>Jun.</hi> Qua e medio tolluntur popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li in lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

According to this Scripture inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, <hi>deſire not the night,</hi> is deſire not death. <hi>Job</hi> had put forth ſuch deſires more than once (<hi>Chap.</hi> 7.15.) <hi>My ſoul chooſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſtrangling and death rather than life.</hi> Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> tranſlates, <hi>Breath not unto that night: for peoples paſſage to their place:</hi> That is, (ſaith he) <hi>deſire not death, the common paſſage of all men, as thou hast done.</hi> Therefore <hi>Elihu</hi> ſeems here to call <hi>Job</hi> off from thoſe deſires; do not thou peevi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <q>When people are cut off in their place.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Death is a cutting off. As many die in the night, ſo when-ever any die they are cut off from this world, and all the imployments of it. they are cut off from their deareſt friends and relations. Death cuts off the thread of life, and us from the comforts of this life.</p>
                  <p>The Hebrew is, <hi>when people aſcend.</hi> The Original Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth <hi>dying by aſcending,</hi> though the death of the wicked is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Thus the word is uſed in the fifth Chapter of this Book, at the 16th verſe, where <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſpeaking of the death of a godly man, ſaith to <hi>Job, Thou ſhalt come to thy grave in a full age, like as a ſhock of corn cometh</hi> (or <hi>aſcendeth) in his ſeaſon. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> deprecated an immature death under this Metaphor (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.14.) <hi>Take me not away in the midſt of mine age.</hi> The word is, <hi>let me not aſcend in the midſt of mine age,</hi> that is, before I have meaſured the uſual courſe of life.<note place="margin">Tranſlatio a condelis, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum lumen aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendit, atque ita paulatim conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muntur ipſa.</note> Thus to <hi>aſcend,</hi> is the ſame with to be <hi>cut off;</hi> death cuts off the beſt from this world, and then they aſcend to a better. This ſenſe of the words ſuits well with the latter expoſition of the <hi>night,</hi> as taken for the night of death. The word <hi>aſcend,</hi> is conceived to have in it a double alluſion; firſt, to corn which is taken up by the hand of the reaper, and then laid down on the ſtubble. Secondly, unto the light of a candle, which as the candle ſpends, or as that which is the food of the fire is ſpending, aſcends, and at laſt goes out and vaniſheth.</p>
                  <p>There is yet a further ſenſe of the whole verſe thus; <hi>Deſire not the night,</hi> &amp;c. That is, do not curiouſly enquire the cauſe of that divine judgement by which God ſometimes ſweeps away whole nations, good and bad together, in the night, or ſuddenly.

                  <p>The Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> quits himſelf from this in one point (<hi>chap.</hi> 17.16.) <hi>I have not deſired the woful day (Lord) thou knowest.</hi> He was ſo far from deſiring it, that he prayed for the peace and proſperity of that people; but though <hi>Jeremy</hi> did not deſire the evil day to come on others, yet when the evil day was come upon himſelf we find him venting ſtrange and ſtrong deſires of that kind (<hi>Chap.</hi> 9.2.) <hi>O that my head were a fountain, and mine eyes ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of tears, that I might weep night and day for the ſlain of the daughter of my People.</hi> He had viſions of ſlaughter, and he did even beg a head melted into water for abundant mourning over that day. But what were his other, what were his further wiſhes, with reſpect to himſelf at that time? we have them in the next verſe. <hi>O that I had in the wilderneſs a lodging place of a wayfaring man, that I might leave my people, and go from them, for they be all adulterers, a company of treacherous men.</hi> What uncomfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able deſires had <hi>Jeremiah</hi> as to that day of diſtreſs!

And as he wiſht this ſad retirement upon the foreſight of evils to come, ſo we find him in another place (<hi>Chap.</hi> 20.14, 15, 16, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) wiſhing that he had never been born to ſee ſuch preſnet evils.

David</hi> was at that time in a very ſad day, you ſee; and what was his wiſh that day? we have it at the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, <hi>And I ſaid, O that I had wings like a dove, for then would I flee away and be at rest; lo then would I wander
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:48335:163"/> far off and remain in the wilderneſs.</hi> Holy <hi>David</hi> could not keep his heart (in thoſe diſtreſſes) from extravagant wiſhes. <hi>David</hi> had the integrity of a dove (as he often pleaded before the Lord) and being diſtreſt, he wiſhed alſo for the wings of a dove, that he might flee away, and get out of the reach of all thoſe impen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent calamities. How uſual is it for good men in bad dayes to breath out ſuch wiſhes? one wiſhes that he had never been born, rather than to ſee ſuch a day; another wiſhes he may die pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, rather than live in ſuch a day. When the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> had given the propheſie of dreadful judgments to come upon the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked world, or the world of wicked men, he preſently tells us what their wiſhes or deſires will be (<hi>Rev.</hi> 9.6.) <hi>And in thoſe dayes ſhall men ſeek death, and ſhall not find it, and ſhall deſire to die, and death ſhall flee from them.</hi> Moſt men flee death, that's a miſery; but death ſleeth from ſome men, and that's a greater miſery. They are in the worſt of conditions who would have death when death will not be had. Their lives are worſe than death who only wiſh to die. What non-ſenſe wiſhes and deſires had they alſo in the day of the Lords anger, mentioned in the ſame book (<hi>Chap.</hi> 6.16.) Who <hi>ſaid to the mountaines and to the rocks, fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that ſitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb.</hi> It is poſſible for good men ſometimes to have ſtrange wiſhes; but O how lamentable are the wiſhes of wicked men and unbelievers, who have no part nor intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt, in thoſe times when Conſcience is wounded and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened, or when a day of the Lords wrath, or judgment from the Lord appeareth! When Chriſt the Lamb ſhall ſit upon the throne, and call them to give an account, O then they will wiſh for rocks and mountaines to fall upon them, that they might not appear; how glad will they then be to be hidden with an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting night! They cannot but <hi>deſire the night, who have ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst light.</hi> Holy <hi>Job</hi> could not forbear to deſire the night of death in the day of his diſtreſs; what deſires then muſt the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed have, who have no hope beyond this life!</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Take heed, regard not inniquity.</hi> As if he had ſaid, <hi>beware, be well adviſed what thou doſt, and what thou ſayest.</hi> The word which we here render <hi>take heed,</hi> ſignifies to keep and preſerve, but moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, to prevent and keep off any evil, that it fall not upon us. The noun, from this root, ſignifies <hi>a watch tower,</hi> upon which a perſon ſtands to obſerve and give warning of any danger, or to deſcry any approaching enemy. 'Tis tranſlated, <hi>take heed,</hi> as here, ſo (1 <hi>Kings.</hi> 2.4.) where <hi>David</hi> upon his death-bed, gives counſel to <hi>Solomon</hi> his ſon and ſucceſſor what to do, and how to walk in the way of the Lord, that (ſaith he) <hi>the Lord may continue his word which he ſpake concerning me, ſaying, if thy children take heed to their wayes,</hi> that is, if they are very watchful over their wayes, both as to their perſonal and princely walkings, if they walk in my ſtatutes, then I will do thus and thus for them. Thus ſaith <hi>Elihu, take heed, look about you,</hi> have your eyes in your head, be careful. Theſe <hi>take heeds</hi> are frequent in Scripture. From whence (before I come to the matter about which <hi>Elihu</hi> would have <hi>Job</hi> take heed.)</p>
                  <p>Obſerve;
<q>It is our duty to be heedful.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>We cannot be dutiful unleſs we are heedful; a headleſs perſon cannot be a faultleſs perſon. This duty runs quite through all we have to do; <hi>take heed,</hi> firſt, to the inward motions of the ſoul, take heed how &amp; what you think (<hi>Pro.</hi> 4.23.) <hi>keep thy heart with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence (with all keepings, with all heedings,</hi> it is this word in the text)
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:48335:164"/> heed thy heart, that is, thy firſt ſtirrings and motions unto any work. Secondly, take heed, as to the firſt motions of the ſoul, ſo to the affections of the ſoul, which are ſoul-motions formed up and ſtated; take heed of your affections, how and what you deſire, how and what you love, how and what you hate. Thirdly, take heed to the tongue, how you ſpeak, and what you ſpeak, where you ſpeak, and why or for what ends you ſpeak; there is a great deal of <hi>take heed</hi> belonging to the tongue. Fourthly, take heed to the ear, when ye hear others ſpeak, take heed how you hear, and when ye hear, and what you hear; infection may ſoon come in at thoſe ports. Fifthly, take heed to the eyes, what you behold; the eyes are win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes which often let in vanity, yea, I may ſay, venome and poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon into the ſoul.

                  </p>
                  <p>But what Iniquity doth <hi>Elihu</hi> here chiefly intend? I anſwer,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:48335:165"/> It is a truth of Iniquity in general, regard not any iniquity; yet here <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeaks not in that compaſs; as if he ſhould ſay, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard not robbery, regard not murder, regard not adultery and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs, regard not any of theſe foul and groſs ſins; but there was a ſpecial ſin which <hi>Elihu</hi> had an aym at, and which he thought <hi>Job</hi> gave too much regard unto; <hi>regard not iniquity,</hi> that is, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due ſpeeches and heart-g udgings, or impatient complainings againſt the proceedings of God with thee; that is, do not ſtand ſo much complaining about what thou ſuffereſt, and juſtifying thy ſelf in what thou haſt done, expoſtulate the matter no more with God, wiſh not for the night of death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This <hi>is to regard or turn thy face to iniquity;</hi> take heed of theſe things, do not regard theſe evils, this kind of iniquity.</p>
                  <p>Further, when <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith <hi>regard not iniquity,</hi> we are to expound him by theſe affirmatives; <hi>ſlight it, turn from it, abhor it, loath it, deſpiſe it, reject it;</hi> all theſe affi matives are contained in that negative, <hi>regard not.</hi> Frequently in Scripture, negatives intend their contrary affirmatives. When that Scripture ſaith, <hi>deſpiſe not propheſying,</hi> (1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.) the meaning is, <hi>ye ſhall regard it,</hi> love i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, follow it, delight in it; ſo on the other hand, when this Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſaith, <hi>regard not iniquity,</hi> the meaning is, <hi>deſpiſe</hi> and oppoſe iniquity to the utmoſt; <hi>Take heed, regard not iniquity.</hi> From this part of the verſe thus opened,</p>
                  <p>Obſerve, Firſt;
<q>It is no eaſie matter to keep our ſelves right when things ſeem to go wrong with us.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is a hard thing to forbear iniquity when we are pinched with adverſity; not to ſpeak unduely and uncomly, not to ſpeak amiſs of God, not to ſpeak unbecoming our ſelves, require <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>reat cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in a day of diſtreſs. We have need to take heed of this iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to be watchful in an evil day, that we neither do nor ſay that which is evil. <hi>When things are amiſs with us, we are very apt to ſpeak and do amiſs.</hi> As ſoon as ever the hand of God toucheth us, how do we grieve! how do we complain! how do we mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur! how do we repine! O regard not this, 'tis an iniquity to be taken heed of, in a dark day, in a day of trouble, ſuch as was upon <hi>Job;</hi> as black a day was upon him, as ever upon any in the world, as to his perſonal condition. If ſuch a Cedar failed, have
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:48335:165"/> not we, poor Shrubs, reaſon to look about in ſuch a day? When an affliction is very great, they that are for reputation great and ſtrong in faith, very choice believers, experienced ſouldiers in the wars of Jeſus Chriſt (when an affliction (I ſay) growes very great) how apt are they to be diſmayed, to be out of heart, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpond, to look upon themſelves as undone, and all undone! O regard not, turn from this iniquity. It ſhould not ſatisfie any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of God that he avoids groſs iniquities in practiſe, he muſt make conſcience of an impatient word, and order his ſpeech a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right under the rod, as well as his converſation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Foraſmuch as <hi>Elihu</hi> calls this an iniquity,</p>
                  <p>Obſerve;
<q>Impatient ſpeeches render us guilty, let our afflictions and troubles be never ſo great.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jobs</hi> affliction was as heavy as the ſand, yet <hi>Elihu</hi> tells him, your complainings are your iniquity. I have had occaſion ſeveral times in this book to ſpeak of the evil of complaining, under the worſt and ſoreſt of afflictions, and therefore I only name it here.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, taking iniquity in the largeſt notion,</p>
                  <p>Obſerve;
<q>Sin deſerves no reſpect from us.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sinners deſerve no reſpect, much leſs doth ſin. 'Tis one part of the character which <hi>David</hi> gives of a Citizen of <hi>Sion, (Pſal.</hi> 15.4.) He is one, <hi>in whoſe eyes a vile perſon</hi> (that is, a wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, a perſon given up to his luſts) <hi>is contemned.</hi> That which makes a perſon vile and contemptible, is worſe than a vile perſon, and therefore ſhould have leſs reſpect, or more contempt from us. Remember, ſin is the only thing which makes any perſon vile; ſhould we then give any reſpect to ſin? ſhould we give reſpect to that which brings utter diſreſpect upon us? have we any reaſon to honour that which brings us to ſhame? to regard that which makes us regardleſs both with God and all good men? However ſome men are regarded with men for their wickedneſs, I mean with wicked men (they regard their like the more, when they are moſt like them) yet (I ſay) ſin makes every man regardleſs with God and every good man: Therefore regard it not, yea, ſlight it, trample upon it. Take that</p>
                  <pb n="322" facs="tcp:48335:166"/>
                  <p>For a Fourth note in the affirmative;
<q>Iniquity is utterly to be diſregarded and abominated;</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>We ſhould abhor it and caſt it out of our ſoules, we ſhould throw it out of our converſation.</p>

<q>To regard iniquity is the marke of a wicked man.</q>

                  <p>Hence note, Firſt;
<q>Sin, or that which is ſinful, ought not to be choſen whatſoever we chooſe.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As <hi>Solomon</hi> counſeleth, in the book of <hi>Proverbs, with all thy gettings get underſtanding,</hi> he meanes ſpiritual underſtanding; as if he had ſaid, <hi>What ever thou are getting be ſure thou get wiſdom for thy ſoul, wiſdom to ſalvation, wiſdom for eternity; in all thy gettings get underſtanding:</hi> So I may lay in this place, <hi>among all your chooſings be ſure you never chooſe ſin; that's not to be choſen, leave that out, or paſs that by in all your elections.</hi> This is a point of very large compaſs; it ſuits not my work here, to inſiſt much upon it, yet I ſhall take leave a little; <hi>What ever you ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>oſe, chooſe not ſin.</hi> Why?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Sin is evil in it ſelf, and that which is <hi>(malum in ſe)</hi> evil in it ſelf, or evil it ſelf, is not the object of choice; no man is to chooſe evil, nor properly can chooſe it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Chooſe not ſin, for ſin is an <hi>evil forbidden,</hi> the Law is againſt it, and the Goſpel too.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Chooſe not ſin, for ſin is a diſhonour to God, and we ſhould rather chooſe to die than diſhonour <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>od.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Chooſe not ſin, for it brings deſtruction upon man.
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:48335:167"/> Sin ſtrictly and abſtractly conſidered cannot properly be choſen. A rational creature cannot chooſe ſin properly, becauſe ſin is evil; and election being the office of the Will, whoſe adaequate obj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ct is good, ſin, ſtrictly taken, cannot be choſen. But ſin is often choſen, and 'tis the choice of moſt men, they chooſe iniquity ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than affliction; iniquity is the choice and the beloved of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a mans ſoul. But how? It is under the pretence of ſomething that is good; no man can chooſe it as 'tis evil. For though ſome love ſin and chooſe ſin for ſins ſake (ſuch come up higheſt and neareſt to the frame of the devil, as they that do good for goods ſake come neareſt to the holy Angels) yet, I ſay, ſin is alwayes choſen under ſome conſideration or ſhadow of good; and if any man chooſe to ſin without reſpect to profit or gaine, yet he hath ſome good in his eye, namely to pleaſe himſelf, he would have his will, and will not let God have his will; and this is good to him who is ſtarke naught. But uſually ſin is choſen upon one of theſe three accounts.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, ſin is very often choſen (by a miſtake) for that which is good. They who (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.12.) <hi>are u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful in the word of righteouſneſs,</hi> they who have not <hi>ſences exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed to diſcern between good and evil,</hi> are very apt to chooſe evil in ſtead of good, that is, thinking it to be good. Thus error in opinion is choſen, upon a miſtake, for truth; and iniquity in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, is choſen, upon a miſtake, for duty. Of ſuch the Prophet ſpeakes (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.20.) <hi>They call evil good, and good evil, they put darkneſs for light, and light for darkneſs:</hi> which, as ſome do know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, out of perverſeneſs of ſpirit; ſo others ignorantly, out of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoundneſs of judgement, imagining that to be good which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and that to be light which is nothing elſe but darkneſs, that to be ſound doctrine which is er<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>our, and that holy worſhip which is ſuperſtition. So did <hi>Paul</hi> before he was converted, he choſe iniquity, and thought he had done very well; <hi>I thought</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I ought to do many things against the name of Jeſus Chriſt</hi> (Acts 26.) I thought it my duty, I verily thought I ought to perſecute and vex thoſe who beleeved in Jeſus, where-ever I found them. And Jeſus Chriſt himſelf forewarns his Diſciples (<hi>John</hi> 16.2.) that <hi>the time was coming, that whoſoever killed them would think they did God ſervice.</hi> Thus many do not underſtand what is right, and ſo chooſe what is wrong.</p>
                  <pb n="326" facs="tcp:48335:168"/>
                  <p>Secondly, Others chooſe that which is evil, hoping that ſome good will come of it, that God may have ſome glory by it, and men themſelves and others may have ſome advantage by it. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach was caſt upon the Apoſtles and their doctrine, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> rejected with higheſt diſdain (<hi>Rom.</hi> 3.8.) <hi>Not as we are ſlanderouſly reported, and as ſome affirm, that we ſay, let us do evil that good may come thereof, whoſe damnation is juſt.</hi> The glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the free grace of God will be manifeſted in the pardoning of our ſin, come therefore (ſay ſome) let us ſin our fill, that ſo the immeaſurableneſs of the Lords goodneſs and mercy may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. Woe to thoſe who make ſuch inferences, their damnation is juſt. To do evil upon any hopes of good by it (though it be the glory of God) ſubjects to the worſt evil of ſuffering, damnation. Others chooſe ſin; Why? They look ſome good will come by it, that is, ſome profit. If we ſtrain our conſciences to do this, we may get or keep favour with men; if we do this evil, it may gain us acceptance in the world. Many chooſe evil, becauſe in doing ſo, they ſwim with the ſtream, and comply with the <hi>many,</hi> or as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, with <hi>the courſe of this world;</hi> theſe chooſe evil, becauſe they would be in the faſhion of the moſt, they conſider which way the world is like to go, and ſet themſelves to go that way.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Others do evil hoping to avoid and eſcape danger by it; they chooſe the evil of ſin, that they may eſcape the evil of puniſhment. As many ſin for a little advantage, ſo others to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void loſs, and that they may ſleep in a whole skin. Some will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny what they have done, to ſave themſelves: No body can prove it againſt us, we will deny it, and ſo avoid trouble, and keep out of the reach of danger. Yea, for this cauſe many deny the truth and renounce the wayes of God, in which they have walked. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> forſook <hi>Paul,</hi> he left the Church of God, that he might keep in with, and cloſe to the world. Upon theſe pretences and hopes many chooſe evil, not meerly and barely in it ſelf, but as it comes thus clothed: As ſome chooſe it through ignorance, ſo others up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hopes of getting good, and not a few upon hopes of avoiding evil, and keeping out of hazzard and harmes-way. But what-ever worldly good any gain, or danger they eſcape, by chooſing iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that choice brings them into greater danger, and ſubjects them to the loſs of a greater good.</p>
                  <pb n="327" facs="tcp:48335:168"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This thou haſt choſen rather than affliction.</hi> The particular <hi>ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi> (as hath been ſhewed) was impatience.</p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>He that gives himſelf up to unquietneſs and impatience under the afflicting hand of God, chooſes ſin rather than af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lord by <hi>Moſes</hi> told his People, when they ſhould be brought into great tribulation, becauſe of their ſin and uneven walkings, becauſe of their breaking the Lords Statutes and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments (<hi>Lev.</hi> 26.41.) <hi>If they ſhall accept of the puniſhment of their Iniquity, then it ſhall be well with them.</hi> If at ſuch a time ye ſtand not complaining and murmuring againſt me, but ſhall well accept or take the puniſhment kindly, and kiſs the Rod, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging how you have provoked me, and walked unworthy of former mercy; then I will ſhew you favour, and renew your mercies: But if in affliction you fall a murmuring, and ſay, ſurely the Lord hath caſt us quite off, there's no hope, you chuſe ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity rather than affliction.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Elihu</hi> in this doth not only reprove <hi>Job</hi> for doing that which was very evil in it ſelf, but he reproves him for doing that which was very evil to himſelf; <hi>this thou haſt choſen rather than affliction.</hi> As if he had ſaid, Thou doſt not know thine own good, in making this choyce. We ſay, <hi>He is a wiſe man that underſtands his own good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>They make a very bad and miſerable choyce for themſelv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s, who chuſe iniquity rather than affliction.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Solomon</hi> concludes for Wiſdom (<hi>Prov.</hi> 8.36.) <hi>He that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth againſt me wrongeth his own ſoul.</hi> He that ſinneth, wrongs Chriſt, but Chriſt paſſeth that over, and ſeemeth to ſay, I will bare your wrongs, but pray take heed to your ſelves, will you not love your ſelves? will you not abſtain from ſin out of love to your ſelves? <hi>he that ſinneth againſt me wrongs his own ſoul; all that hate me</hi> (that is, my wayes) <hi>they love death:</hi> And ſurely there is no great beauty in death, that we ſhould love it and deſire it. <hi>They chuſe very ill for themſelves, that chuſe ſin,</hi> the wages where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is death. I grant, to chuſe affliction is but a hard choyce (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:48335:169"/> is not good in it ſelf) but affliction, if choſen, may prove good; it may be very good to us, it may bring in much good to us: and therefore there is wiſdome, not only in chuſing any afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, rather than ſin, but in chuſing ſome one affliction rather than another. But what good doth he chuſe, that chuſes ſin? Happy is the man that endures correction, or affliction, ſaith the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in many places; but doth it ſay any where, <hi>Happy is the man that commits iniquity?</hi> If you chuſe affliction rather than iniquity, you chuſe a great deal of good. Firſt, <hi>David</hi> could ſay upon try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.71.) <hi>It is good for me that I have been afflicted, that I might learn thy ſtatutes.</hi> Did ever <hi>David</hi> ſay, it is good for me that I have ſinned, which is to unlearn or break Statutes? did he ever pleaſe himſelf in thinking that he had ſinned? he did even pleaſe himſelf that he had been afflicted; that was good, becauſe he learned Commandments by it; he grew a better Scholler, then he was in that beſt learning of all, the knowledge of the Commandments of God.</p>
                  <p>Again, Secondly, It is good to be afflicted; why? afflictions are the exerciſes of our Graces, the exerciſe of our Faith, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of our patience, the exerciſe of our ſelf-denyal. 'Tis a good thing to have our Graces exerciſed, for thereby they are encreaſed. If you chuſe affliction, you ſhall probably have that good by it, the encreaſe of your beſt things, your Graces.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Affliction purgeth out our corruptions, and that is good. Is it not good to have a diſeaſe, or an ill humour, purged out? this good comes by affliction. But doth the committing of ſin purge ſin? doth the Stock of ſin abate by ſinning? does the ill humour ſpend it ſelf? no, the ill humour rather increaſeth. When you chuſe ſin, you weaken your Graces, and cheriſh your corruptions; but when you refuſe ſin, your corruptions weaken or ſpend their ſtrength. Do you think when you have committed one ſin, that the ſoul is made more unable to, or more averſe from the ſame or another ſin? When you have ſatisfied the call of one luſt, will it now let you alone, and call no more? no, not at all; the more you ſin, the more you may; the more you ſin, the more doth the Stock of ſin increaſe and grow in you.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Affliction is a means to take us off or wean us from the World: O what a good is that! we being ſo apt to dote
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:48335:169"/> upon it. The ſin of the Age is, falling in love with the World; therefore it may be good for us to be ſoundly afflicted, that we may be weaned from the World, and from all things in the world, and be kept, where our true intereſt is, in the boſom of Chriſt, or cloſe to him. But if you chuſe iniquity, will that take you off from the World? no; the more ſin, the more love of the World; for ſin and the World are akin, they are of a Blood; therefore the more you have to do with the one, the more you will have to do with the other.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Affliction b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ings us nearer to God. That which takes us off from the World, brings us neerer to God: this is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent advantage, a great good of affliction. But chuſe ſin, and will that bring us neerer to God? Sin is a departure from God: The Lord ſaith to ſinners, <hi>Ye are departed and gone.</hi> Sin is ſo far from bringing us nearer to God, that as all in a ſtate of ſin, are far off from God, ſo every act of ſin widens the diſtance, and puts us farther off from God.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Affliction is our conformity to Chriſt. If you chuſe affliction, you chuſe that which makes you look like Chriſt; for he was a man of ſorrows in this world, he was not in the ruff and jollity, in the power and pomp of this world, but low, and of no reputation, acquainted with grief all his dayes. If then you chuſe affliction rather than ſin, you chuſe conformity to Chriſt; but chuſing iniquity rather than affliction, you take up the utmoſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to Chriſt, <hi>who knew no ſin, n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>r was any guile found in his mouth.</hi> He took all our afflictions upon him, but he would not touch our ſin, as a doer of it, only as (in our ſtead) a ſufferer for it.</p>
                  <p>How great is the good of affliction! But is there any good at all in ſin? Upon all theſe conſiderations the Apoſtle ſaith, When God, the Father of ſpirits, afflicts his ſons and daughters, he doth it <hi>for their profit, that they may be partakers of his holineſs</hi> (Heb. 12.10, 11.) The Lord afflicts us for our profit, but he doth not ſay I have let you ſin for your profit: For though the Lord is able to, and often doth, bring good out of ſin, yet not inſtrumentally, but occaſionally. Therefore the Scripture at<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ributes no profit to ſin, but ſpeaking of ſin, it ſaith, <hi>What fruit have ye of thoſe things whereof ye are now aſhamed</hi> (Rom. 6 21.) ſhew your gain; what are your advantages? what the revenues which your luſts
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:48335:170"/> have brought in? what have you got by your malice, by your wrath, by your conformity and compliance with the world? have theſe b ought you in any advantage? are you bettered by them? what fruit have you of thoſe things, whereof you are now aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Let us therefore often conſider <hi>Moſes</hi>'s choyce (<hi>Heb.</hi> 11.25.) <hi>Moſes</hi> was a wiſe and a holy man; and what did he? He choſe <hi>rather to ſuffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon.</hi> Herein try your ſpirits. Chriſt ſet two things before <hi>Moſes;</hi> Come, <hi>Moſes,</hi> here's affliction, you muſt be afflicted, and afflicted with the people of God (which are the greateſt afflictions, you ſhall be ſure to be laſhed with the ſmarteſt ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

In this choyce <hi>Moſes</hi> approved himſelf a wiſe man, and underſtood his good. So did the Martyrs. Come, will you have a p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iſon, or deny Chriſt? a Halter, or forſake the Faith? will you into this fire, or will you commit that iniquity? O ſay they, give us Priſons, Halters, Fires, rather than conform to your wickedneſs. Remember this Point, this is a needful Point for us at all times. I would adde theſe three things further about it. Chuſe affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction rather than ſin; why?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe ſin is worſe than all affliction. Secondly, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſin is the Sting of all affl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ction. If you are in an afflicted condition, and your conſciences tell you you have been baſe, vile, complying with the VVorld, and diſſembling or falſe-hearted with God; if your hearts tell you, you have been rotten at the heart, this will be the ſting of your afflictions. What is the ſting of death? The Apoſtle anſwers (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.56.) <hi>The ſting of death is ſin.</hi> Would a man chuſe a ſting? Surely you chuſe a ſting when you chuſe ſin, and that which will afflict you beyond all your afflictions.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Sin is worſe than affliction, for when God would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his ſevereſt wrath, and bring the greateſt affliction upon the children of men, when he reſolves to affli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t a perſon or a people to the utmoſt, he doth not ſay, I will make this man a poor man, or I will ſend plague, or ſickneſs, or famine among this people,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:48335:170"/> but he ſaith, I will deliver him or them up into the hands of their ſins, or to the power of their luſts. (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.11.) <hi>Iſrael would none of me</hi> (ſaith the Lord) they were coy, they had other lovers, they would have the world, they choſe ſin, rather than God, and to go a whoring after the creature, rather than keep cloſe to him. What then? <hi>So I gave them up to their own hearts luſts.</hi> As if the Lord had ſaid, <hi>Pray take your courſe, you that love your own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, take your fill of them, you that love and would have the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of the world, take your fill of them.</hi> The Lord doth not threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten them with famine and peſtilence, no nor with hell, but he threatens them with ſin, and leaves them to the power of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Thus he gave up the old Gentile <hi>Romans to vile affections, (Rom.</hi> 1.26, 28.) Let them be victorious, let them be rich, let them ſubdue all Nations under their iron hands, let <hi>Rome</hi> be the Head and Miſtreſſe of the world, and command all people, let all ſtoop to their power, but ſaith God, <hi>I will give them up to vile affections,</hi> they ſhall be baſely Idolatrous, and baſely wanton, and baſely gluttonous, and baſely drunken, and baſely ambitious, and baſely envious: As they were above all people of the world in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward glory and power, ſo God left them under the power of their luſts, and gave them up to glut themſelves with wickedneſs; <hi>He gave them up to a reprobate minde, to do things that are not conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient.</hi> 'Tis the moſt terrible of all afflictions, when God makes a ſin an affliction, and gives men up to hardneſs of heart, to pride, to a ſpirit of looſneſs and wantonneſs; here is a miſchief indeed, the miſchief of ſin.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Obſerve;
<q>Our Avoydance of, or eſcape from the greatest affliction in the world, will not bear us out in the choyce of any iniquity.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>We may underſtand and proſecute this poynt two wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>As to guilt.</hi> It will no way excuſe us before God, to ſay, I forbore to do duty when commanded by God, I did evill becauſe commanded by man, not out of any diſlike of my duty, or liking of iniquity, but only to avoyd thoſe afflictions, which I ſaw inevitably falling upon me, in caſe I had either done the one, or not done the other. This plea will not hold before God, for
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:48335:171"/> any mans diſcharge from guilt upon either account. And though there may be ſome ſea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ons wherein a duty may be laid by or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, yet there is no ſeaſon wherein any iniquity may be choſen or committed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We cannot be excuſed, as to <hi>Diſcretion.</hi> We are fools, and act below, not only <hi>gracious</hi> but <hi>rational</hi> men, if we chuſe iniquity to avoyd any affliction, whether that affliction or ſuffering, be, firſt, our own; or ſecondly, the ſuffering of others. Firſt, though nearly related, &amp; very near to us, wife, children, &amp;c. Secondly, though many, never ſo many, a whole Nation, a whole world, the Church. I believe that aſſertion of St <hi>Auguſtine</hi> will be found ſound and Orthodox Divinity; <hi>Better let the world pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, than attempt to ſave it by telling an officious ly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The evil of ſin is ſo bad that if any good could come by it (which of it ſelf cannot) it were not worth the having: Some ſaid in the Apoſtles times, &amp; they ſaid it of the Apoſtles, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 3.8.) <hi>Let us do evil that good may come of it.</hi> God by his infinite power, wiſdome, and goodneſs, brought good out of evil, even ſalvation to man out of the fall of the firſt man; but if any man, or ſort of men, ſhall project the obtainment of good by the doing of evil, the Apoſtle in the ſame place hath given them this doom, <hi>Their damnation is juſt;</hi> nothing is more juſt or righteous, than their damnation, who hope to get good for themſelves or others by doing evil, which is it ſelf injuſtice and unrighteouſneſs.</p>

                  <p>IN theſe two verſes <hi>Elihu</hi> proſecuteth the admonition which he had given <hi>Job</hi> in the 21 verſe, to take heed of uttering any thing raſhly concerning Gods dealings with him, or, of <hi>chooſing iniquity rather than affliction:</hi> And he preſſeth the admonition by two great arguments.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>He hath the power in himſelf. The word which we render <hi>power,</hi> ſignifieth,</p>

                  <p>Secondly, Inward might and ſtrength, whether acquired or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, the might of the mind, wiſdome and pollicy.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Civil might and power, honour and riches. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever maketh a man ſtrong, comes under the notion of this word; and every way, in all the Notions of power, God is exalted. <hi>He exalteth by his power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſeeing 'tis barely aſſerted <hi>(He exalteth by his power)</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing being expreſſed, it may be queſtioned, whom doth he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt? or what doth he exalt? I anſwer, Foraſmuch as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture leaveth it at large, and undetermined, we may apply this aſſertion to any, either thing or perſon. God exalteth whom he pleaſeth, and what he pleaſeth. VVe may take it diſtinctly theſe five wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, He exalteth <hi>Himſelf</hi> by his power; that is, he exalteth his own Name and Glory, which is neareſt to him, yea, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He exalteth every work which he will undertake and engage upon: He doth not only lay the Foundation of his work, and rear up the VValls a little way, but he exalteth by his power till he hath ſet up the <hi>Head-ſtone</hi> of his work (as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Zechariah</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.7.) all that love and fear him <hi>ſhouting and crying, Grace, Grace, to it.</hi> He exalteth his works of Providence, as once he did his work of Creation, to full perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Lord exalteth thoſe that fear him, for they are moſt properly his <hi>Favourites;</hi> and whom ſhould he exalt but thoſe whom he favoureth? All the worldly exaltations of evill
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:48335:173"/> men, are but depreſſions and abaſements, compared with thoſe exaltations and advancements which God intendeth for all that fear him; and ſome he exalteth much in this VVorld.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, and more ſpecially, He exalteth by his power (ſuch <hi>Job</hi> then was) thoſe that are caſt down by the oppreſſing power of men, even the poor, and thoſe that have no help. <hi>Thou art he</hi> (ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 9.13.) <hi>that lifteſt me up</hi> (or <hi>exalteſt me) from the gates of death.</hi> When I am periſhing, when I am ready to be ſwallowed up with death, when I am at the greateſt loſs, even as to life it ſelf, then thou lifteſt me up, thou lifteſt me up from the very gates of death. Again, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.48.) <hi>He deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth me from mine enemies, yea thou lifteſt me up above thoſe that riſe up againſt me:</hi> When they are caſting me down, God is exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and raiſing me up. And if God will raiſe up, who can keep down?</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, We may take the words in this general ſenſe; Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is exalted in this world, God exalteth him. The Sparrow cannot fall to the ground, nor the leaſt thing or perſon be lifted from the ground, but by the hand of God. As he exalteth ſome in a way of ſpecial favour, ſo he exalteth the worſt of men in a way of common providence: As none can be exalted if he ſay, no; God is able to put a barr or a ſtop to any mans exaltation; ſo he can exalt whom he will, and none are able to put a barr or a ſtop to their exaltation. <hi>Behold, God exalteth by his power.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpake this purpoſely to <hi>Job,</hi> who was in a low condition, brought (as it were) to the very gates of death; and he makes this large deſcription of the power of God in exalting thoſe that are caſt down, purpoſely to comfort <hi>Job,</hi> to erect his ſpirit, and cheare his heart, with a bleſſed confidence, that how much ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he was at preſent under-foot, or under-hatches, yet he might hope for better things, even to be lifted up, if he humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf under the mighty hand of God.

Thus <hi>David</hi> ſhews how God is teaching while he is chaſtening (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 99.12.) <hi>Bleſſed is the man whom thou chaſteneſt, O Lord, and teacheſt out of thy Law.</hi> God teacheth, Firſt, by his Word, (that's his ordinary way of teaching) Secondly, he teacheth by his Works; and thoſe both the workes of Creation and of Providence, and by thoſe, whether workes of Mercy or of Judgement: By all theſe meanes God teacheth. But that which <hi>Elihu</hi> chiefly aimeth at in this place (ſpeaking to afflicted <hi>Job</hi>) is his teaching by affliction, <hi>Who teacheth like him?</hi> As if he had ſaid, God doth not lay his hand upon thee by affliction, only to make thee ſmart, but to make thee wiſe; he is inſtructing thee while he is afflicting thee. Further, as God teacheth by his Word and by his Works, ſo he teacheth moſt eminently by his Spirit, who alone maketh the teaching both of his Word and of his Works effectual upon the hearts of the hearers and beholders. Many are taught, but none to purpoſe, without the Spirit. <hi>Who teacheth like him?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note Secondly;
<q>God is no ordinary teacher; The teachings of God are above all other teachings; There is no teacher to be compared with God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Elihu</hi> doth not ſay, Who teacheth beſides God? There are many other teachers, but there is not one who teacheth like him. Some may ſay, wherein doth the excellency of divine teaching lie? how hath that the ſupereminence above all other teachings? Take the anſwer briefly in ſeven words.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, none teacheth ſo plainly and clearly as God. The teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of men are but dark and obſcure to the teachings of God. Chriſt ſaid (<hi>John</hi> 16.26.) <hi>I ſhall no more ſpeak unto you in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables, but I ſhall ſhew you plainly of the Father.</hi> God ſpeaks by his Word and Spirit to the loweſt and meaneſt underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <pb n="340" facs="tcp:48335:175"/>
                  <p>Secondly, none teacheth like God; that is, ſo mildly, ſo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately, ſo condeſcendingly to the condition and capacity of thoſe with whom he hath to do. Chriſt ſaid (<hi>John</hi> 16.12.) <hi>I have many things to ſay unto you, but ye cannot bear them now;</hi> and therefore I will not ſay them now, <hi>I will not bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thirdly, none teacketh like God, ſo patien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ly and meekly. There is nothing doth more provoke the paſſion of a teacher, than the untowardneſs and dulneſs of thoſe that are taught. It was a very good Rule given by one of the Ancients, <hi>he that will teach children, muſt in a manner be a child;</hi> He muſt conſider what they are, and forme himſelf to their condition, elſe ſhe will never have the patience to teach them. O with what patience doth the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and only wiſe God teach his children! (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.9, 10.) <hi>He gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth line upon line, and precept upon precept, here a little and there a little.</hi> Here is the patience of God; He doth not ſay, if ye cannot take it now, I will teach you no more; No, ſaith God, I will give precept upon precept, and line upon line; though former precepts have not been received, yet I will give you more, <hi>here a little and there a little,</hi> ye ſhall have another little to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer little. God was forty yeares tutoring and teaching the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi> in the wilderneſs, to fit them for the poſſeſſion of <hi>Canaan. Theſe three yeares,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>have I come looking for fruit,</hi> and all that while he was teaching them, to make them fruitfull; nor was he haſty then, but upon the in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Fourthly, none teacheth like him, that is, ſo conſtantly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually; He teacheth, and he is alwayes teaching; there is no hour, no moment, but one way or other God is reaching; By every thing we hear, or have to do with, in the wayes of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, he is teaching us. B ſides, how conſtant is God in teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us formally, as 'tis ſaid, in the Prophet (<hi>Jer.</hi> 35.14, 15.) <hi>I have ſent unto you all my ſervants the prophets, riſing up early, and ſending them:</hi> As if the Lord did beſtir himſelf in the mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ning, to ſend our teachers betimes. <hi>He ſoweth his ſeed in the morning, and in the evening he doth not with hold his hand,</hi> as he requireth us to

                     </gap>ighbour, or, of piety and holy worſhip towards him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf (<hi>Eccl.</hi> 11.6.)</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>none teacheth like</hi> him, that is, ſo truly, ſo unerringly. While men teach they ſometimes miſ-teach, while they lead, they often miſ-lead; they teach error for truth, and unſafe doctrine for ſound; they build wood, hay and ſtubble, in ſtead of gold, ſilver, precious ſtone, upon that ſure foundation Jeſus Chriſt (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.12.) The beſt, the wiſeſt, and moſt knowing men may erre; only God knoweth the full compaſs of all myſteries, yea he is Truth; therefore his teachings are moſt true.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>none teacheth like him;</hi> that is, ſo <hi>authoritatively.</hi> Men teach in the name and authority of God; but God teacheth in his own name and authority. The Lord giveth Authentity to his own word. If the Lord hath ſaid it, that's warrant enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it and believe it. When Chriſt preached, the people won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at his doctrine (<hi>Mat.</hi> 7.29.) <hi>For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the Scribes;</hi> that is, there went forth a mighty command with the word of Jeſus Chriſt; He did not, as I may ſay, beg attention and ſubmiſſion to his doctrine, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act it upon them, and draw it from them. Where God teacheth, he commandeth, his word worketh mightily; when he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, all muſt hear at their peril. Wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

                  <p>Seventhly, who teacheth like him? that is, ſo <hi>effectually,</hi> ſo efficatiouſly. As God hath authority to charge his teachings up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us at our peril to receive them, ſo he hath a power to work our hearts to the receiving of them. Who teacheth thus like God? The M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>iſters of Chriſt teach in the authority of God, and charge all to receive what they ſay in his Name, but they cannot give an effect to the charge (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 48.17.) <hi>He teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to profit.</hi> One tranſlation ſaith, <hi>He teacheth things profitable.</hi> But that is a lean rendring, for ſo doth every Miniſter that teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as he ought; but our rendring carrieth the efficacy of the word of God in it, <hi>He teacheth to profit;</hi> that is, he can make the dulleſt Scholar learn, he can make the moſt ſtubborn heart to ſubmit. Chriſt ſpeaking of this great work of God in teaching,
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:48335:176"/> ſaith (<hi>John</hi> 6.45.) <hi>No man cometh unto me, except the Father draw him.</hi> What is that drawing? It is this teaching, as ye may ſee (<hi>verſ.</hi> 45.) <hi>Every one therefore that hath heard and learned of the Father, cometh unto me.</hi> That is, every one whom the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath vouchſafed to teach and inſtruct, that man cometh to me, that is, he believeth and obeyeth the Goſpel, and ſubmitteth both in judgment and practiſe. <hi>Every one that hath heard and learned of the Father cometh to me:</hi> There is not one whom God hath undertaken to teach, that doth miſcarry. (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 32.4.) <hi>The heart of the raſh ſhall underſtand knowledge;</hi> or, the heart of the haſty. Now haſty and raſh perſons, are heady and inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate perſons, and therefore none of the wiſeſt; they uſually have little judgment or diſcretion, who are much in paſſion; but God can make the <hi>heart of the raſh to underſtand knowledge;</hi> that is, he can make them underſtand and know things aright, who ſeem moſt uncapable of, and are naturally at the greateſt diſtance from a rightneſs of knowledge and underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>To cloſe the Point, take theſe inferences from the who I.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, If God be ſuch a teacher, then <hi>ſtay not in the bare teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of men.</hi> What are the teachings of men to the teachings of God? Though you ſhould have an Angel from heaven to ſpeak to you, yet ſtay not in his teachings, wait for the teachings of God. Till ye are taught of God ye never learn to purpoſe. Set your ſelves, not only as in Gods preſence, but as under his Spirit, to be taught; wait for the moving of the Spirit in every ordinance, as they did for the Angels moving of the waters, who lay at the poole of <hi>Betheſda</hi> for healing (<hi>Joh.</hi> 5.4.)</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Seeing God teacheth thus paramount, ſeeing <hi>none teach like him,</hi> then <hi>ſubmit to his teaching.</hi> Do not queſtion any of his rules of life or doctrines of faith, they are all righteous and full of divine truth; you cannot do amiſs if you do, nor believe amiſs if you believe, no, nor miſs of bleſſedneſs in doing and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, what he hath taught.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Then appear as they who are taught of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You will ſay, How, or when doth it appear, that we are or have been taught of God? I ſhall anſwer that query in four things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, If you are or have been taught of God, <hi>his teaching unteach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eh</hi> or emptyeth you, &amp; that in a threefold reſpect. Firſt, of your own carnal principles. The great buſineſs of divine teaching, is to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teach,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:48335:176"/> to take men off from their own Will and Reaſon, from their own Rules, as alſo from thoſe Cuſtomes which they have received by tradition from their fathers. If you would appear as taught of God, you muſt lay down all theſe. The teachings of grace empty the ſoul of what it hath taken up by Nature. Secondly, the teachings of God empty the ſoul of all ſelf-righteouſneſs. If ye be taught of God ye will be nothing in your ſelves. <hi>Paul,</hi> before the teachings of God came, had confidence in the fleſh, and boaſted in his own righteouſneſs; but when he was taught of God, he threw off all thoſe. Thirdly, If ye are taught of God, that will certainly unteach and empty you of all unrighteouſneſs. The Apoſtle ſpeakes fully to that (<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.20, 21.) <hi>Ye have not ſo learned Chriſt, if ſo be that ye have been taught as the truth is in Jeſus.</hi> If ye have been divinely taught, then this teaching hath emptyed you of the old man; as of all ſelf-righteouſneſs ſo of all unrighteouſneſs towards others. It is impoſſible any ſhould take in the teachings of God, and yet hold any ſinfull practiſings.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, divine teachings, as they empty and unteach the ſoul, ſo they keep it very humble. Knowledg endangers us naturally to high thoughts of our ſelves, and hath a tendency in it to p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ide (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.1.) <hi>Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth.</hi> Take knowledge barely as received of men, even the knowledge of divine things (for ye may have a humane knowledge of divine things) this uſually makes the heart ſwell; but the knowledge we have from the teachings of God, makes us humble, it will cauſe us to cry out (as the Prophet did, when the Lord appeared and let out a more than ordinary manifeſtation of his glory, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.5.) <hi>we are undone.</hi> It was ſo with <hi>Job,</hi> when the Lord had ſchooled him, and made himſelf more fully known to him th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

Where we ſee any proud of what they have learned, it is an argument that either they were never taught of God, or, that as yet they have not underſtood his teachings.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The teachings of God do not only empty and humble the ſoul, but they transform the ſoul, and change it into another thing than it was, as to its ſtate and qualities: The teachings of
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:48335:177"/> God change not only our manners but our very natures; they not only give a light to the Underſtanding, but a newneſs to the Will, new Affections, new Deſires. This is it which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle calls <hi>the new creature</hi> (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17.) and that this creature is wrought to its higheſt perfection by the teachings of God, he ſheweth (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18.) <hi>We all with open face, beholding as in a glaſs, the glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame image from glory to glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi> The glaſs wherein we have this ſight of the glory of God, is chiefly the Word. The glory into which we are changed by thoſe ſights, is our confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to that holineſs which ſhineth in the Word. And this change is twofold; Firſt, from ſin to grace, which is a degree of glory. Secondly, from glory to glory, that is, from a high to a higher, and at laſt to the higheſt degree of grace. Look what the Word is, and calleth us to be, that are we when taught according to the truth of the word, by the power and Spirit of God.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The teachings of God confirm the ſoul in that which is taught, or we have learned. If God teach any divine leſſon, that will ſtick. We receive many leſſons from men, and let them ſlip, as the Apoſtles word is (<hi>Heb.</hi> 2.1.) Doctrine taught us of God ſettles upon us, we hold the ſubſtance of it, and hold forth the fruit or power of it in every ſeaſon of our lives: yea, if trouble or perſecution ariſe for the truth, they who are taught of God will hold it faſt, though they let go all they have in this world for it. If God teach us the doctrine of Free Grace, how we are juſtified by the righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, without our own works; If God teach us the doctrine of pure Worſhip, how he is to be ſerved, and honoured according to his own will, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Traditions of men, (as Chriſt ſpake (<hi>Mat.</hi> 15.9.) If (I ſay) God teach us theſe, or any other ſaving truths, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but hold them: whereas they who have received them from men will part with them on the account of man. Only that which God hath taught us abideth with us, and that no man can take from us. Men may take the life of ſuch a one from him, which God hath given him, but they cannot take the truth from him which God hath taught him. What God teacheth, is written, as it were, with a pen of iron and the point of a diamond, it is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon the tables of the heart for ever. Thus we may in ſome meaſure diſcern who are taught of God; and ſeeing they who
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:48335:177"/> are taught of him, are ſo taught, we may very well inſiſt upon <hi>Elihu</hi>'s chalenge; <hi>Who teacheth like him?</hi> And as there is no teacher like God, ſo neither is there any ruler like God; this alſo is taught us by <hi>Elihu,</hi> as a matter out of queſtion, while in the next verſe he proceeds to make more queſtions, or two queſtions more.</p>

                  <p>This verſe holds out two things. Firſt, the ſoveraignty; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the integrity of God. God is ſupream in power, and he is righteous in the uſe of his power, and therefore, O <hi>Job,</hi> thou haſt much forgotten both thy ſelf and him, in making ſo many complaints about thy condition, which is indeed to enjoyn God his way, or preſcribe to him how he ſhall govern the world. And ſeeing no man hath enjoyned God his way, who can queſtion him about it, what way ſoever he is pleaſed to take, either with whole Nations, or with any of the ſons of men.</p>
                  <q>Who hath enjoyned him his way, <hi>or,</hi> viſited him?</q>
                  <p>No man hath, no man can, <hi>enjoyn him his way.</hi> God hath no viſitors over him. Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> renders, <hi>Who gave him charge over his wayes.</hi> Like that, <hi>Chap.</hi> 34.13.</p>
                  <p>The way of God is any courſe which himſelf taketh, either in governing the world in general, or any perſon in particular; who ſhall inſtruct him about either what or how he ſhall do, whom he ſhall ſpare, whom he ſhall puniſh, whoſe heart he ſhall ſoften, whoſe he ſhall harden, whom he ſhall ſave, whom he ſhall deſtroy, how he ſhall teach, which way he ſhall lead; in a word, how he ſhall adminiſter juſtice and order any of his matters? all muſt be bound to and by his Lawes, he cannot be bound to or by the lawes and preſcripts of any, either in works of Judgment or of Mercy, either in doing good to and for man, or in dealing out of evil. Further,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Who hath enjoyned him his way?</hi> By the way of God we may underſtand both the actions of God themſelves, as alſo the reaſons moving him to thoſe actions. As if <hi>Elihu</hi> had ſaid, <hi>Who hath taught God what to do? Who hath, or who can direct him what to do? Who may be ſo bold with God, who is the ſoveraign Lord over all
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:48335:178"/> the earth, thus to enjoyn him his way?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>God is the firſt mover of all that himſelf doth;</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>No man hath ſhewed him or enjoyned him his way. He is the fountain of light, he ſeeth what to do; who hath been his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor? (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16.) that is, no man hath, or may inſtruct him (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.13. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.34.) Again, he is the fountain of power; none hath authority to direct him, he is above all; as he needs not the counſel of any, ſo he receiveth the rule from none. I have had occaſion more than once in the proceſs of this Book, to ſay ſomewhat of the ſoveraignty of God over all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and therefore only remind it here, <hi>Who hath enjoyned him his way?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>Or who can ſay, thou haſt wrought iniquity?</q>
                  <p>The world is full of iniquity, but in God there is none at all. As God is not obliged to give any men an account of his works, ſo no man can find any, the leaſt, real fault or defect in any of them; and if his works do not appear ſo to us now, yet at laſt they will appear to all without any ſhadow of iniquity. <hi>Samuel</hi> called to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and demanded (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.3.) <hi>Whoſe oxe have I taken?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Whom have I defrauded?</hi> &amp;c. Come charge me, witneſs againſt me; who can ſay, I have wrought iniquity? It was much, and a rare thing for <hi>Samuel</hi> to carry it ſo juſtly, that none could challenge him; but when all the world ſhall be ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned before God, he will be able to put the queſtion, Who of all the ſons of men, can ſay, I have wrought iniquity? None can ſay it, but with utmoſt impudency and higheſt blaſphemy. It is impoſſible for God to work iniquity; not only is his Command, but his Will totally againſt it. What-ever God works is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his own Will, and his Will is the Rule of Righteouſneſs; therefore he <hi>can do no iniquity.</hi> There is no iniqui y in acting or working according to the Law. If men act according to their will, they uſually act iniquity, becauſe their will is no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> a Law, and 'tis ſeldome conformed to the Law. The will of no man is ſo right, or ſo fixed in the right, as to be received fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> a Law. But ſeeing what-ever God doth, he doth it according to his o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n Will, and his Will is the righteous Rule of all things, therefore all muſt be
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:48335:178"/> right which he doth: Who-ever took him tripping in his dealings? <hi>Who can ſay, he bath wrought iniquity?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But why doth <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeak thus to <hi>Job?</hi> Had he ever ſaid that God works iniquity?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, He had not. Yet becauſe he thought God might have done better by good men, or have given out that which was more ſuitable to their eſtate, than ſuch continual ſorrows and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions as he endured, therefore this ſaying is deſervedly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to him. For, it would have become <hi>Job,</hi> and doth every man, to ſay, that is beſt done which God do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h, and that he hath choſen or pitched upon the beſt, and moſt proper meanes of doing his own choiſeſt ſervants good, even when 'tis worſt with them in the world, or, when he afflicts them with the greateſt evils; For, <hi>Who can</hi> (then) <hi>ſay, he hath wrought iniquity?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve;
<q>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> The infinite purity of God, as alſo his love to righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and juſtice;</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Who, though he be ſo abſolute in power, that none can call him in queſtion (<hi>none can enjoyn him his way,</hi> and therefore none can queſtion him for his way) yet he is ſo perfect in righteouſneſs, that no fault can be found in him, nor any error in his way. Though the Lord hath power to do what he will, yet he hath no will to do wrong with his power. The Lord neither doth nor can do wrong to thoſe who have, to their power, continually wronged him. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, he that hath all power in his hand, can have nothing but right in his heart. How few are there in power (though their way be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to them, though they have power meerly by commiſſion, from ſuperior powers, though their power be ſuch as they are to give an account of, yet, I ſay, how few are there in power) who do not much iniquity, who do not, either for want of better informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or, of a better conſcience, oppreſs, grieve and afflict thoſe that have to do with them, or are ſubject to them! God may do what he will, yet will do nothing but what is right. How infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then is God to be exalted in his truth and righteouſneſs! And thus the word of truth exalts him (<hi>Deut.</hi> 32.4. 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 19.7. <hi>Rom</hi> 9.14.) There is no unevenneſs, much leſs aberration in any of the ways of God, he never trod awry, nor took a falſe ſtep; <hi>Who can ſay unto him</hi> (without great iniquity) <hi>thou haſt wrought ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="348" facs="tcp:48335:179"/>
                  <p>Hence we may infer;</p>
                  <p>If God works no iniquity in any of his wayes, whether in his general or ſpecial providences, Then,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>All ought to ſit down quietly under the workes of God.</hi> Though he bring never ſo great judgments upon nations, he doth them no wrong; though <hi>he break his people in the place of dragons, and cover them with the ſhadow of death,</hi> he doth them no wrong; <hi>Though he ſell his own people for nought,</hi> yet <hi>he doth them no wrong.</hi> All which, and ſeveral other grievances, the Church ſadly bemoans (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.) yet without raiſing the leaſt duſt, concerning the juſtice of God, or giving the leaſt intimation of iniquity in thoſe ſeveral ſad and ſevere wayes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We ſhould not only ſit down quietly under all the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of God, as having no iniquity in them, <hi>but exalt the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of God in all his diſpenſations, as mingled alſo, &amp; ſprinkled with mercy.</hi> Though we cannot ſee the righteouſneſs of God in ſome of them, yet we muſt believe he is not only ſo, but merciful in all of them; though the day be dark, &amp; we cannot diſcern how this or that ſu es with the righteouſnes, much leſs with the goodneſs and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>od, yet ſit down we ought in this faith, that both this and that is righteous, yea, that God is good to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in the one and in the other. When the prophet was about to touch upon that ſtring, he firſt laid down this principle as unqueſtionable (<hi>Jer.</hi> 12.1.) <hi>Righteous art thou, O Lord, yet give me leave to plead with thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thy Judgments: Why doth the way of the wicked proſper?</hi> Why is it thus in the world? I take the boldneſs to put theſe queſtions, O Lord, yet I make no queſtion but thou art righteous, O Lord. It becomes all the ſons of men to reſt patiently under the darkeſt providences of God. And let us all, not only not charg God fooliſhly, but exalt him highly, and cry up both his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and kindneſs towards all his people; For <hi>who can ſay to God, thou haſt wrought iniquity?</hi> Having in ſeveral other paſſages of this book, met with this matter alſo, I here briefly paſs it over.</p>

                  <p>THeſe two verſes contain the third advice, counſel or exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation given by <hi>Elihu</hi> to <hi>Job,</hi> ſtirring him up to give glory to God in his providential proceedings with him.</p>
                  <p>There are three things conſiderable in theſe two verſes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The general duty commanded, which is, to <hi>magnifie the work of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, We have here a ſpecial reaſon or ground of that duty; the viſibility and plainneſs, yea, more than ſo, the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtriouſneſs of his work. The work of God is not only ſuch as ſome men may ſee, but ſuch as <hi>every <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>ay ſee,</hi> yea, <hi>behold a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>far off.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We have here an incentive to provoke to this duty, in the firſt words of the Text, <hi>Remember.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <bibl>
                        <hi>Verſ. 24.</hi>
                     </bibl> Remember that thou magnifie his work, which men behold.</q>
                  <p>To <hi>Remember,</hi> imports chiefly theſe two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, to call to mind what is paſt (<hi>Mat.</hi> 26.75.) <hi>Then Peter remembred the words of Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, To remember, is to keep ſomewhat in mind againſt the time to come; in which ſence the Law runs (<hi>Exod.</hi> 20.8.) <hi>Remember the rest-day;</hi> that is, keep it in mind, that when-ever it cometh, or upon every return of that day, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> may be in a fit poſture and preparation for it; <hi>Remember the reſt,</hi> or <hi>ſabbath day to keep it holy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To remember in this place, is ſet (I conceive) in a double oppoſition: Firſt, To forgetfulneſs of the duty here called for; remember and do not forget it. Secondly, To the ſlight per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the duty here called for; the magnifying of the work of God.</p>
                  <q>
                     <pb n="350" facs="tcp:48335:180"/>Remember that thou magnifie.</q>
                  <p>As if he had ſaid, <hi>Be thou daily and duely affected with it,</hi> do not put it off with a little, or a bare remembrance; the matter is weighty, conſider it fully. As if <hi>Elihu</hi> had ſaid to <hi>Job, Thou haſt much forgotten thy ſelf, and gone off from that which is thy proper work. I have heard thee much complaining of the workes of God, but thy work ſhould have been to magnifie the work of God. Though God hath caſt thee down and laid thee low, yet thy buſineſs ſhould have been to exalt the work of God; Remember, it would much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter become thee to act another part than this; thou ſhouldest have acted the part of a magnifier of the work of God, not the part of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainer gainst it.

                  <p>The root ſignifieth, to encreaſe and extol. We may conſider a twofold magnifying of the work of God. There is an inward magnifying of the work of God; and there is an outward magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the work of Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> it; thus did the Virgin in her ſong (<hi>Luke</hi> 1.46.) <hi>My ſoul doth magnifie the Lord.</hi> Her heart was raiſed up, and ſtretched out in high thoughts of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is an outward magnifying of the work of God. To ſpeak highly of his work is to magnify his work; to live holily and fruitfully is to magnifie his work. We cannot make any addition to the work of God, there is no ſuch magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of it; but we muſt ſtrive to give the works of God their full dimenſion, and not leſſen them at all. As we muſt not diminiſh the number of his works, ſo we muſt not diminiſh the juſt weight and worth of them. There is ſuch a charge of God to the Prophet about his word (<hi>Jer.</hi> 26.2.) <hi>Go tell the people all the words that I command thee to ſpeak unto them; diminiſh not a word.</hi> Deliver thy meſſage in words at length, or in the full length of thoſe words in which it was delivered unto thee. We then magnifie the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>k of God, when we diminiſh not a tittle. As we cannot add any thing to it, ſo we muſt neither abate nor conceal any thing of it. To magnifie, is not to make the works of God great, but to declare and ſet forth the greatneſs of them;
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:48335:180"/> that's the magnifying here eſpecially intended. <hi>Remember that thou magnifie his works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall not ſtay upon that other reading, <hi>Remember that thou art ignorant of his work.</hi> The ſame word which we tranſlate,<note place="margin">Memento quod ignores opus ejus. Vulg. <hi>Hieronimus confundit</hi>

                     </note> to <hi>magnifie,</hi> with the variation of a point, ſignifieth <hi>to erre;</hi> hence that tranſlation. There is a profitable ſenſe in it; for indeed the beſt knowledge which we have of the work of God may be called ignorance, and we ſaid to be ignorant of that work which we are moſt knowing in. Yet becauſe this is ſtraining of the Text, I paſs it by, and keep to our own rendring, <hi>Remember that thou magnifie</hi>
                     <q>His work.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>What work? Here is no work ſpecified, therefore I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, All the workes of God are here included; Magnify his work. What-ever is a work of God, what-ever hath the ſtamp and inſcription of God upon it, ſee that thou magnifie it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, and more ſpecially, We may unde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſtand this work of God to be the work of Creation,<note place="margin">Hujus mundi opificium intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligo. <hi>Bold.</hi>
                     </note> the goodly ſtructure and fabrick of this viſible world; and indeed that's a work ſo great and magnificent, that it ought to be continually remembred and magnified.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Others reſtrain it more narrowly, to that part of the work of God which is eminent in the heavenly meteors, and wonderful changes in the air, together with the motions and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of the ſtars, of which we ſhall find <hi>Elihu</hi> diſcourſing at large, like a divine Philoſopher, in the next Chapter. There are ſtrange works of God in theſe lower heavens, where thoſe mete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors are born and brought forth; <hi>Remember to magnifie thoſe works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, I rather conceive (though ſuch works of God are afterward ſpoken of) that <hi>Elihu</hi> intends the work of Providence in both the appearances of it, as it is a white or black work, as it is for good or for evil, as it is in judgment or in mercy. A mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Interpreter pitcheth upon the former, and upon one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular of the former; as if <hi>Elihu</hi> had directly led <hi>Jobs</hi> thoughts back to the Deluge, that work of God in bringing the Flood upon the old wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ld; and if we can but go back and honour God for his paſt works of Providence, we ſhall magnifie him for his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:48335:181"/> As if <hi>Elihu</hi> had ſaid; <hi>Thou complaineſt that thou art over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed with a deluge of afflictions; but doeſt thou remember how God deſtroyed the whole world at once in the univerſal flood?</hi> But though I think, that may be taken in among other works, yet to reſtraine it to that is a great deal too narrow for this Text. Therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this work of God, we may comprehend any great work of God, which is upon record, or which we have heard of, wherein he hath ſhewed his power, wiſdome, and juſtice.</p>
                  <q>Remember his work;</q>
                  <p>The work of providence. Thoſe works of providence which are afflictive, have a great place in this Text, becauſe the perſon ſpoken to was one in an afflicted condition. And I conceive <hi>Elihu</hi> directs <hi>Job</hi> not ſo much to magnifie God for the day of proſperity and Sun-ſhine which he once had, as for the day of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity and darkneſs, which then covered him. <hi>Remember that thou magnifie his work,</hi>
                     <q>Which men behold,</q>

                     <hi>Brough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> gloſſe expreſſeth it out of <hi>Ramban.</hi> Gracious and holy men do not only ſpeak, but ſing the wonderful works of God; And, that praiſes were in ſong or verſe, both the Scriptures and many ancient Authors teſtifie. God works, and men ſing the praiſes of God for his works, as <hi>Moſes, David,</hi> and <hi>Deborah</hi> did. And we find all the Saints (<hi>Rev.</hi> 15.3.) ſinging praiſes to the Lord for the great work which he will do in bringing forth Judgement to perfection upon <hi>Babylon.</hi> Thus it is a truth, the work of God is to be ſung and ſet forth in meeter, or in verſe.</p>
                  <p>We take the other tranſlation, <hi>Which men behold;</hi> which, with reſpect to that which followeth (<hi>v:</hi> 25.) where both expreſſions
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:48335:181"/> refer to the eye, is, I conceive, moſt proper. <hi>Magnifie the work of God, which men behold;</hi> As if <hi>Elihu</hi> had ſaid, O <hi>Job,</hi> I adviſe thee to leave off ſearching into the ſecrets of God, and ſet thy ſelf to conſider and magnifie thoſe works of God which are plain and lye open to every mans eye.</p>
                  <p>The word rendred <hi>Behold,</hi> may note, both a tranſient, and an intenſe or fixt beholding, to look wiſhly as we ſay, to look faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the eye ſolicitouſly, yea, it imports, not only to behold with the eye of the body, but with the eye of the mind.</p>
                  <p>Some Interpreters put an Emphaſis upon the word <hi>men,</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, There are inviſible works of God, which we cannot behold, but muſt believe, and can know only by faith; ſuch are his ſpiritual works, or what he works upon or in the ſpirits of the children of men: Theſe are written in too ſmall a letter for the eye of Nature to behold; none can ſee them or behold them but by an eye of faith, or ſpiritual underſtanding. The works of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation and ſanctification (for which God is wonderfully to be magnified) may be ſeen or beheld in the fruits and effects of them, in thoſe they are very viſible, but they cannot be ſeen in themſelves. The paſt and future providences of God cannot now be ſeen by the eye, but by faith they may, and we ought to believe that ſuch things were wrought, and ſhall be wrought; we are to receive the teſtimony given by faithful Hiſtory, that ſuch things were done, though we never ſaw the doing of them, and we are to receive the ſure word of Prophecy that ſuch things ſhall be done, though we live not to ſee the doing of them.

Things that are high and afar off, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſedly ſeen, not clearly or fully diſcerned. A man that is afar off cannot be diſtinguiſhingly knowne. When a man is afar off, we may ſee him to be a man, but what manner of man he is, or who he is, we cannot diſcern; though poſſibly it may be our own fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet being afar off we cannot know him diſtinctly. Thus to ſee afar off notes only a confuſed knowledge. That's a good ſenſe; things afar off are not diſtinctly ſeen.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Afar off,</hi> may be expounded of all the ſight we have on this ſide Heaven.

                  <p>The <hi>memento</hi> or remember at the beginning of the verſe is no more than needs. We have bad memories for any thing that's good, eſpecially for the good word and the good works of God. We are ſo far from magnifying his work, that we often forget his work.

                  <p>While we remember it, we do not magnifie it; while we ſpeak of his work, we ſeldome praiſe his work.

<q>The beſt men need monitours and remembrancers to quicken them about their duty of magnifying the works of God.</q>

But O what need have we of a remembrancer, to put us in mind of the work of God, and to magnifie his work! We need a dayly remembrancer to put us in mind of what we ſhould do, how much more of what God hath done! We need to be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of that which 'tis a wonder how we can forget, our latter end, or how frayle we are; how much more do we need to be minded of thoſe duties which fit us for our latter end, and lead us to thoſe enjoyments which never end!</p>

                     </gap>urthly, Obſerve;
<q>Such is the ſinfulneſs of mans heart, and his ſluggiſhneſs, that he hardly remembers to magnifie God for thoſe works which he cannot but ſee.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Elihu</hi> urgeth <hi>Job,</hi> and with him all men, to remember that they magnifie even that work of his <hi>which men behold,</hi> and which every man may ſee. How ſlack are they in or to that great duty of mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying God, who when they ſee, or may ſee, if they will, his mighty works, yet mind not the magnifying of him!</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Obſerve;
<q>Some works of providence are ſo plain, that every man, that doth not wilfully ſhut his eyes, may behold them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He is altogether ſtupid and blockiſh, that ſeeth not what all may ſee. Hence the Pſalmiſt, having ſaid, <hi>O Lord, how great are thy works,</hi> concludeth ſuch among brutes and fools, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 92.6.) <hi>The brutiſh man knoweth not, neither doth a fool underſtand this.</hi> It was the ſaying of <hi>Plato</hi> an Heathen; <hi>That man is worthy his eyes ſhould be pulled out of his head, who doth not lift them up on high, that he may admire the wiſdome of the Creatour in the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <pb n="358" facs="tcp:48335:184"/>
                  <p>Sixthly, Conſider why doth <hi>Elihu</hi> thus charge it upon <hi>Job?</hi> ſurely to humble him for his ſin, in that he did not magnifie God for his works.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note;
<q>It is a great aggravation of our neglect of praiſing God for his works, or of our not magnifying the works of God, ſeeing his works are obvious to every man, even to the weaker and ruder ſort of men.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the very blind may ſee them, how ſinfully blind are they, who ſee them not! The works of God ſhould be ſought out, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 111.2, 4.) If they lie in corners, yet they are to be ſought out, and they are ſought out <hi>of them that have pleaſure therein.</hi> If God ſhould hide his work under ground, if God ſhould put his Candle under a buſhel (as Chriſt ſaith men do not, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.) yet 'tis our duty to ſeek it out, and ſet it upon a Candleſtick, that all may behold it, and praiſe him for it. Now if the moſt hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den works of God muſt be ſought out, that they may be magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſurely then, when the works of God ſtand forth and offer themſelves to our view and we cannot tell which way to draw our eyes from them, how great a ſin is it, not to behold them, not to give him the glory of them.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, Obſerve;
<q>To magnifie the works of God is mans duty, yea it is a moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and indiſpenſible duty.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the poynt chiefly intended by <hi>Elihu</hi> in his preſent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with <hi>Job;</hi> This containeth the ſum and ſubſtance of the whole Text. To magnifie the work of God is ſo neceſſary, ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſible a duty, that A <hi>remember</hi> is put upon it, leſt at any time it ſhould ſlip from us. The Lord knowing how great, how weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, how comfortable, how profitable a duty it is to keep the <hi>Rest day,</hi> prefixeth this word, <hi>Remember the Sabbath day to keep it ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> (Exod. 20.8.) I might give inſtance from ſeveral other Scriptures, importing thoſe duties which have a <hi>memento</hi> put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to be of great neceſſity, and that the Lord will not bear with us if we lay them by, or neglect the conſtant performance of them. To forget any duty is very ſinfull, how much more thoſe which we are ſpecially warned to remember that we do them!
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:48335:184"/> 
                     <hi>David</hi> was not ſatisfied in doing the duty of the text alone, but muſt aſſociate others with him in it. (<hi>Pſ.</hi> 34.3.) <hi>O let us mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the Lord together;</hi> that's a bleſſed conſort, the conſort of the bleſſed for ever. The whole work and reward too, of Saints in heaven is, and eternally will be, to magnify God; and they have the beginnings of that work and reward, who are ſincerely magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying his work here on earth. <hi>God hath magnified his word</hi> (in all things) <hi>above his name (Pſal.</hi> 138.2.) and the reaſon is, becauſe his workes anſwer or are the fulfilling of his word to the praiſe of his glorious name. Now if God hath magnified his word by his workes then we muſt magnifie his workes, or him in his workes, For wherein doth God magnifie his word but in his works? He hath magnified his work by bringing his word forth in his works: Surely then if God hath magnified his word by bringing it forth in his works, then 'tis our duty to magnifie the works of God, which are the product, effect and anſwer of his word.</p>
                  <p>But ſome may ſay, how is that done? I would give anſwer to this queſtion in five things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Then we magnifie the work of God, when we magnifie God for his work: we cannot magnifie the mercy of God, but by magnifying the God of our mercys; We cannot magnifie his work while we neglect himſelf. we magnifie God in his work, firſt, when we aſcribe the whole efficiency of what we ſee done in the world, to him, and ſay, <hi>This is the ſinger of God,</hi> Or when we ſay, according to this or that time, <hi>What hath God wrought? (Numb.</hi> 23.23.) To magnifie the work of God is to give the whole of it to God. 'Tis the hand of God upon a work that ſets the price upon any wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>k, and makes it worthy to be magnified. As in ſome Pictures, this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ets a price upon them, to ſay they are ſuch a mans work, the work of ſuch a famous Artiſt, the work of <hi>Apelles,</hi> or of <hi>Michael Angelo.</hi> So if we would magnifie any p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ovidential work, we muſt ſay, it is the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>k of the great God, it is he that ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h done it; the eye of our mind muſt look directly at God in ruling and governing of the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ld. While we pore much upon, or ſtay our thoughts about ſecond cauſes, we cannot exalt the work of God; though we call it Gods w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rk, yet if our hearts hang about ſecond cauſes, the work cannot be exalted as his. 'Tis a depreſſion of the work of God to put any thing of man upon it. To honour the work of God is to give him the
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:48335:185"/> whole effect of the work. As we then magnifie God when we look to him alone, with a ſingle eye, as the end of all our works (There is nothing doth magnifie God in what we do, but our looking to God as the end of all we do; Let our work be what it will, never ſo glittering, never ſo gay and glorious in the eye of the world, yet if it be not conſigned over to God, it is a baſe and pittiful work; if any man dedicates his work to himſelf he diſhonours his work: Now (I ſay) as it magnifieth our work when we make God the end of our work) ſo that which magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth Gods work, is, when we look upon him, not only as having an hand in it, but as being both the beginner and ender of it. If we take or give this to the creature, that is, ſit down in this or that Inſtrument, as the means by which we have attained our end, or as the end of what we have attained, we ſpoil the work as to God, or deſpoil God of his work. Remember, this, and this only, magnifieth our work, when we with a ſingle eye look to God as the author and as the end of it. Every work we ſee done is mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, and God in it, when we look to God as the <hi>Alpha and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mega, as the Author and Ender</hi> of it. Nor is this true only in thoſe works of God which he doth more immediately, but where men act moſt, and are very inſtrumental. Let us therefore aſcribe every work to God, and that firſt, in afflicting us; ſuch an eye <hi>Joſeph</hi> had (<hi>Gen.</hi> 45.8.) <hi>It was not you that ſent me hither, but God;</hi> that is, not ſo much you, as God (ſaith <hi>Joſeph</hi> to his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren) I do not ſay it was you (though you were unkind brethren) it was not you that ſent me hither, but God: I look at him more than at you in that great affliction, which was brought upon me by your envy and unbrotherly unkindneſs towards me. Such an eye <hi>David</hi> had when he was under a very grievous, black, dark providence, when his ſon roſe up againſt him, and when his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject <hi>Shimei</hi> curſed him, even then he magnified that work of God, by aſcribing it wholly unto him (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.10.) <hi>The Lord hath ſaid unto him, curſe David.</hi> He magnified God in that great affliction by looking at the hand of God alone in it, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by <hi>Shimei</hi>'s, both undutifulneſs and extream malignity. He ſaid as much, while he tells us he ſaid nothing, in a like or as bad a caſe (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.9.) <hi>I opened not my mouth, becauſe thou di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>st it.</hi> Hence that reproof in the Prophet (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.12.) <hi>They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard not the work of the Lord, nor conſider the operation of his hand.</hi>
                     <pb n="361" facs="tcp:48335:185"/> Secondly, Let us aſcribe every wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>k to God in exalting us; ſuch an eye had the Church to God (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.1, 2, 3.) <hi>Our fathers have told us, what work thou didſt in their dayes;</hi> Thou didſt drive out the heathen by thy hand, and plantedſt them, they got not the land in poſſeſſion by their own ſword, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but by thy right hand, and thine arm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here is no mention at all of <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s achievements and famous victories in ſubduing the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> &amp;c. All is given to God, and he alone exalted for that exalting work. That's the firſt anſwer: Then we magnifie the work of God, when we acknowledge him alone both in afflicting and exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Then we magnifie the work of God, when we beat out, as it were, and ſift all the circumſtances of his work (as we ſay) to the bran, that ſo we may find out every perfection, every glory of it: when we do not only behold and ſee the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>k, but when (as direction is given, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 48.) <hi>We walk about Zion, tell her towers, and conſider her pallaces,</hi> that is, when we do not look upon things only in the bulk, but make an exact ſcrutiny, or take a full view of every part. We cannot magnifie the work of God by a bare beholding of it, but by prying into every circumſtance of it, or by conſidering what excellencies and rarities are in it. As we magnifie our ſinful works (in one ſence we ſhould magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our ſins, that is, aggravate them, not magnifie them to applaud them, or glory in them, but to make our ſelves aſhamed of them, as (I ſay) we magnifie our ſinful works, or what we have done ſinfully, when we conſider all the circumſtances of our ſins, as committed againſt light and love, againſt mercy and goodneſs, againſt the patience and forbearance of God, againſt our own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions and promiſes, againſt our experiences and priviledges, all which ſhould oblige us to holineſs, and engage us to a gracious circumſpection in all our wayes, and walkings, leſt at any time we ſhould ſin againſt God and grieve his Spirit: So we magnifie the works of God when we eye all the circumſtances of them, and conſider them as done for us when we could do nothing for our ſelves, as done for us when we muſt have periſhed and been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, unleſs God had appeared for us; as done for us when we deſerved not the leaſt good to be done for us; as done for us when none would do any thing for us, none caring for our ſoules; as done for us when none could do any thing for us. Theſe and ſuch like
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:48335:186"/> circumſtantial conſiderations, exceedingly magnifie the work of God. A bare <hi>behold,</hi> a tranſient <hi>look</hi> may diſcover no great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but if we ſeriouſly weigh every particular, we ſhall then ſee cauſe enough to magnifie the: work of God. <hi>Eliah</hi> (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.43.) commanded his ſervant to go look towards the ſea, and when he went firſt, he ſaw nothing, but being commanded to go ſeven times, he at the ſeventh <hi>ſaw a little cloud riſing out of the ſea, as big as a mans hand;</hi> but at the laſt, <hi>heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain.</hi> If we would look a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and again, if we would look ſeven times upon the work of God, that which at firſt ſeemed nothing, or afterwards no bigger than a mans hand, or no bigger than a mans hand could effect and bring about, will at laſt be magnified to ſuch a vaſtneſs, that all muſt confeſs, the hand of God hath done it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We then magnifie the works of God, when we freely ſubmit to God in them, as juſt and righteous, when we accept and take them kindly at his hand, not only when they are outward kindneſſes, but croſſes. All the great words and rhetorick we can beſtow upon the works of God will not magnifie them, unleſs we freely ſubmit to them as juſt and righteous. They that would mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the works of God, muſt ſay, <hi>Judgment and righteouſneſs are the habitation of his throne,</hi> while they can ſee nothing but <hi>Clouds and darkneſs round about him (Pſal.</hi> 97.2.) I (ſaith the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt) am in the dark about all that God is doing at this day, yet of this I am as confident as confidence it ſelf, <hi>Judgment and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs are the habitation of his throne;</hi> I know God doth nothing amiſs, no not in the leaſt. Thus <hi>John</hi> in the <hi>Revelation (Chap.</hi> 15.3.) ſaw them that <hi>had gotten the victory over the beast, and over, his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name,</hi> and they (ſaith he) ſing the Song of <hi>Moſes. &amp;c. ſaying, great and marvelous are thy works, just and true are thy wayes.</hi> The works of God in Judgment upon <hi>Babylon,</hi> are full of juſtice, and we mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie them by proclai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing and crying them up as juſt; yea, the work of God in judgment upon <hi>Zion,</hi> is exceedingly magnified, when <hi>Zion</hi> ſubmits to it, and embraceth it as juſt and righteous. It was the great ſin of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when they ſaid (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 18 25.) <hi>The wayes of God are not equal.</hi> As if they had ſaid, are theſe the Lords equal dealings, that we his People ſhould be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up to the hand of the enemy, and ſuffer ſuch things as theſe?
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:48335:186"/> yea, the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> muſt ſay, all the works of God, not only his exalting works, but his humbling works, are equal, juſt and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, for we have ſinned. This is to magnifie the work of God.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, To magnifie the work of God, is to look upon his work what-ever it is, not only as having juſtice in it towards all men, but as good and being full of goodneſs to his People. Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly it may be very hard work, yet we muſt bring our hearts to ſay it is good work, good to and for the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God. Thus the holy man of old magnified the work of God (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.1.) <hi>Truly God is good to Iſrael.</hi> This he ſpake while he was bemoaning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf under very afflicting providences. We magnifie the afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing works of God, when we ſubmit to them as juſt, much more when we embrace them as good. And it was very much the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of <hi>Elihu</hi> to bring <hi>Job</hi> off from diſputing about the evils with which God had ſo long exerciſed him, to a ready yeeldance that they were good for him, and that in all the Lord intended nothing but his good.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, To magnifie the work of God, is to anſwer the end of it. Every work is magnified when it receiveth its end; if a work be done; yet if it have not its effect, if it bring not that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to which it was deſigned, the worker receives no honour from it, nor is the work honoured. To work in vain, is a debaſing, a leſſening of any work, not a magnifying of it. The Apoſtle was afraid to beſtow his labour in preaching the Goſpel in vain. When people ſtill continue in their blindneſs and unbelief, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this layeth the preaChing of the Goſpel low; but when ſouls are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced and converted, and come flocking in, then the Goſpel is magnified, <hi>and the word of the Lord glorified,</hi> as the Apoſtle pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it might (2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.1.) Now as the word of God is magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied when it attains its end, ſo the work of God is magnified when we give him, or come up to thoſe ends for which he wrought it: But if we let God loſe the end of his work, we do what we can to debaſe his work, as if he had done it in vain. We ſay, he works like a fool that hath not propoſed an end to every wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>k he dot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>; and he appears not very wiſe, at leaſt not very powerful, who a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth not the end or ends for which he began his work. The moſt wiſe God hath his end and aim in all his works in this world; and this is the honour we do his work, when we labour, firſt, to know, and ſecondly, to give him his end in every work.</p>
                  <pb n="364" facs="tcp:48335:187"/>
                  <p>But if any ask, What are the ends of God in his work?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, They are very various.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The chief end of all that God doth, is the advancement of his own Name and Glory. As he made all things for himſelf in Creation, ſo he doth all things for himſelf in Providence. That which is the ſin of man is the holineſs of God, to ſeek himſelf. It is moſt proper for God, who is the chief good, and whoſe glory is the ultimate end of all things, to ſet up himſelf in all things (<hi>Prov.</hi> 16.4.) <hi>The Lord hath made all things for himſelf,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon.</hi> And the Apoſtle faith as much (<hi>Rom.</hi> 11.36.) <hi>Of him and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever, Amen.</hi> All things are of him, therefore all things ſhould return unto him. If we would magnifie any work of God, we muſt be ſure to give him this end, the glory of it. Let it not ſatisfie us, that we are advanced, or get up by the works of God, unleſs we our ſelves advance his glory by them. Many advance themſelves, and are lifted up with pride, when God works for them or by them, not at all minding that which they ſhould chiefly mind, the glorifying of God in &amp; by what he hath w ought, either for themſelves or others.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God hath this in deſign, by all his works, to make us better. If it be a work of Judgment, it is to make us better, and then we exalt his works of Judgement, when we are bettered by them, when we are more humbled and weaned from the world by them. And as 'tis the deſign of God to make us better by his works of Judgment, ſo by all his works of mercy. The Apoſtle <hi>beſeecheth us by the mercies of God, to preſent our bodies</hi> (that is, our whole ſelves) <hi>a living ſacrifice,</hi> in all holy ſervice to himſelf (<hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1.) What will it advantage us to be bettered in our outward enjoyments, by what God works or doth for us, unleſs we learn to be better, and do his work better? that is, unleſs our hearts be more holy, and we more fruitful in every good word and work. Some will magnifie the work of God by keeping a day of thankſgiving, becauſe they are richer or greater by what God hath wrought for them, who yet are not a whit more holy or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual by it. Wo to thoſe who magnifie the work of God becauſe they think it ſhall go better with them, when themſelves are not better. Enquire therefore what luſt hath the work of God mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved you to mortifie, wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> grace hath the work of God put you upon the exerciſe of: They only indeed magnifie the work of
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:48335:187"/> God who have ſuch workings towards God. It were better not receive a mercy, than not to be bettered by a mercy. It is not our crying up the works of God in our words, but in our works, which is the magnifying of them. It is more ſafe for us to ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of what God hath wrought for us, than to publiſh it, or make our boaſt of it, when we our ſelves do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>hing worthy of it, in a way of condecency and proportion to it. 'Tis the deſign of God in giving promiſes to make us <hi>cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs of fleſh and ſpirit, perfecting holineſs in the fear of God</hi> (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1.) Much more having given us any great performances of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, doth he expect that we ſhould be clean and holy. O then what a pittiful courſe do they take, who pretending to magnifie the works of God, do ſuch things as are a defilement both to fleſh and ſpirit!</p>
                  <p>A third deſign of God in working for us, is to make us truſt him more, or, to be more in believing. 'Tis ſhewed (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.4.) what great things God did for the Jewiſh nation, and for their fathers; But what did God ayme at in all? we have the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer (<hi>v.</hi> 8.) <hi>That they might ſet their hope in him, and not forget his workes.</hi> The aim which God had in thoſe great works, was that their hope might be ſet upon him; that they might truſt in him more then ever they had done. The Lord, by the great works he doth, would gain upon our faith, or cauſe us to truſt him for the future. How diſhonorably do they carry it towards God, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not his word, much more they who believe not his workes, that is, who believe him not, notwithſtanding his workes, as 'tis ſaid of <hi>Iſrael (Pſ.</hi> 78.32.) <hi>For all this they ſinned ſtill; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved not his wondrous works.</hi> The Pſalmiſt doth not mean, that they did not believe ſuch works had been done; but the meaning is, they did not truſt God who had done thoſe wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ks. Theſe and many more dutyes the Lord teacheth us by his word, and he teacheth them alſo by his workes, as it is ſaid (v. 22.) <hi>who teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth like him?</hi> The Lord teacheth us many excellent leſſons by his works, if we had hearts to learn them. Lay theſe things toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in practiſe, and they will be the beſt, yea, they are the only way of magnifying the works of God done for us. And, if the works of God are to be magnified all theſe wayes, then they fall ſhort of this duty,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Who only make a report of the works of God, who tell
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:48335:188"/> the ſtory of what he hath done, and ſo have done. As we ought to adorne the doctrine of God (<hi>Tit.</hi> 2.) ſo likewiſe the doings of God, or what God hath done, by our doings, Meer narratives about the work of God, is far below magnifying his work.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They fail much more who extenuate and diminiſh the works of God, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     </gap>bſcure or eclipſe his workes. As in our confeſſions of repentance, it is a ſign of a bad heart barely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port our ſins before God, without aggravating them in their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs; but in confeſſion to extenuate our ſin ſheweth a very rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and naughty heart; ſo in our confeſſions of praiſe, meerly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o report what God hath done for us, without putting an accent or a due emphaſis upon his mercies, ſhews much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oldneſs of ſpirit in the duty; but to clip and leſſen the workes of God, to hide and darken them, to abate and detract from them, ſhewes a baſe and a wicked ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, How do they fail in magnifying the workes of God, who do not only conceal how good they are, but bring up an ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port upon them, as thoſe ſearchers did upon the land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> Thoſe works and diſpenſations of God, which (like that land) ſlow with milk and honey, may be looked upon and cenſured by ſome, as good for nothing but to eat up and conſume thoſe that are under them.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, They who ate impatient under any work of God, who murmur and repine at it, are far from magnifying the work of God.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, They are far from magnifying the work of God, who think themſelves ſo wiſe that they could mend the work of God; had they the penſel in their hand they would make fairer work of it: what hudling is here? think ſome; what confuſion is here? ſay others; what ſad work is here? ſaith a third. If we had the ordering of things what an orderly wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ld would we make, if we had the ordering of things (as God hath) we would quickly cure and remedy all theſe diſorders. Though ſuch formal ſpeeches be not uttered, yet ſuch things are ſpoken in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables, the actions of ſome tell us ſuch are their thoughts, as if they could mend the work of God, and govern the world with greater moderation than tis; though indeed we need not ſcruple to call the wiſeſt man in the world a very dotard, if he thinks ſo, or that any thing can be done more equally than God hath done it. Let all
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:48335:188"/> fleſh adore, let none preſume to queſtion the work of God; let God alone with his work; as he will have no controler, ſo he needs no counſeller. Remember, tis mans duty to <hi>magnifie his work,</hi> not to mend it, to ſhew how good it is, not to attempt the making of it better. And indeed as it is the higheſt poynt of preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo of ignorance, to meddle with the mending of it. <hi>The Lord is a Rock</hi> (ſaith <hi>Moſes, Deut.</hi> 32.4.) <hi>and his work is perfect.</hi> Who but a fool, or who but by the over-working of his own folly would venture to mend that which is already, not only perfected, but perfect, were it only the work of a man, much more when it is the work of God, the only wiſe God?</p>
                  <p>And that we may be provoked humbly to magnify, and for ever deterred from that proud attempt of finding fault with, or mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the work of God, conſider theſe three things;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Take the argument in the text, the plainneſs of the work of God, it is ſuch as may be ſeen afar off, none can pretend igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of it, or if they do, that's a vain covert, or excuſe; every man may ſee it, man may behold it afar off, as moſt worthy to be mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If we do not magnifie the work of God, God will leſſen his own works of mercy and favour toward us.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He will do no more for us if we magnifie not what he hath done. It is ſaid (<hi>Math.</hi> 13.58.) Chriſt <hi>did not many mighty works there, becauſe of their unbeleif.</hi> God will do no more mighty works for them, who refuſe or neglect to pay him a tribute of praiſe and glory for what he hath done.</p>

                     </gap>ſt, the chief, and the beſt being, and his doings are ſuch as he is, he doth like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. God is great, and he hath <hi>an excellent, an excelling greatneſs. Praiſe him</hi> (ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 150.2.) <hi>according to his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent greatneſs,</hi> or as the words may well bear, according to his <hi>muchneſs of greatneſs;</hi> for when the Scripture ſaith, <hi>God is great,</hi> this poſitive is to be taken as a ſuperlative, <hi>God is great,</hi> that is, he is greateſt, he is greater than all, ſo great that all perſons and all things are little, yea, nothing before him (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.15.) <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the nations are (to him but) as the drop of the bucket, and are counted but at the ſmal dust of the ballance: behold, he taketh up the Iſles as a very little thing, they are as nothing, and they are counted to him as leſs than nothing and vanity.</hi> How great is God in compariſon of whom the greateſt things are little things, yea, the greateſt things are nothing!</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Behold, God is great.</hi> From this excellent Attribute, <hi>the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God,</hi> I have made ſeveral Inferences already, at the 12th verſe of the 33d chapter; yet I ſhall infer ſome things further here, both for our direction and conſolation.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, If God he great and greateſt, <hi>then fear him greatly. Great is the Lord</hi> (ſaid <hi>David,</hi> in his thankſgiving-ſong, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.25.) <hi>he alſo is to be feared above all gods;</hi> that is, above all the great powers on earth, and above all the imaginary powers of heaven. Idols, who are the fancied powers of heaven, are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times called gods in Scripture; ſo likewiſe are Princes or Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, who are eal powers on earth. Now, ſaith <hi>David</hi> (who was one of thoſe gods, and a great one) <hi>fear him above all gods:</hi> Why? Becauſe he is above all gods, he is higher than the higheſt and he is greater than the greateſt; therefore fear him above all gods, yea, therefore <hi>fear, or worſhip him all ye gods (Pſal.</hi> 97.7.) Many ſay with their mouthes, God is great, yea, infinitely greater
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:48335:190"/> than man, yet they fear men, eſpecially great men, more than God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If God be great, <hi>then love him greatly.</hi> Shall this great God have but little love from us? The Law of love, with reſpect to God, is expreſt two wayes in Scripture; firſt, as to the truth of it; and ſecondly, as to the meaſure or degree of it. The love which is given to God muſt be a true love, a ſincere love, yet not only ſo, but the love which is given to God muſt be the greateſt love; <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul, and with all thy might, and with all thy ſtrength;</hi> with all thy heart ſincerely, with all thy might and ſtrength greatly.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If God be great, <hi>then ſerve him greatly,</hi> or do him great ſervice. Take heed of offering the lean and the lame, the halt and the blind to this great King. A great King muſt not be put off with little ſervices with ſmall pittances of duty.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, If God be great, then <hi>believe him greatly;</hi> let us have great faith in the great God. Jeſus Chriſt rebukes his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples (<hi>Mat.</hi> 8.26.) <hi>O ye of little faith;</hi> have you God to pitch your faith upon, who is great? have you his power, and his mercy, and his truth, and his faithfulneſs, all which are great, to reſt upon? and have you but a little faith? That woman (<hi>Mat.</hi> 15.28.) gave glory to God in believing, when ſhe believed greatly; and therefore Chriſt cryeth up and magnifyeth the greatneſs of her faith, <hi>O woman, great is thy faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>The great God is greatly to be praiſed;</hi> he doth great things for us, therefore we muſt return great thanks to him. That alſo we have expreſly (1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.25.) <hi>Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praiſed.</hi> The great God muſt have great praiſes, for he doth great things.

                     </gap>eateſt, to the higheſt, becauſe the great God, the high God is concerned in it, or it is conſigned to the great, to the high God.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, If God be great, <hi>we ought to give him great ſubmiſſion,</hi> or to ſubmit greatly to him. Great ſubmiſſion to God is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:48335:190"/> of all duty to God. We owe the full ſubmiſſion of our wills to the Will of God in a twofold reſpect. Firſt, to whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he willeth us to do, or to his commanding will. Secondly, to whatſoever he will do with us, or to his diſp ſing Will. In theſe, and in all things, let us ſtrive to g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Secondly, If God be great, then we may infer for conſolation.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Be not diſcouraged in prayer when you have great things to ask, when your wants are great, and your ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities urgent, when you muſt have great ſupplies, when ſmall matters will not ſerve your turn (In many ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es, it is not a little help, it is not a ſmall matter which will do the thing which we ſue unto God for) now here is a mighty ground of comfort for us, if we want great things, we have a great God to go unto; and how great ſoever our wants are, they are all but ſmall to the greatneſs of that God unto whom we go (<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.20.) <hi>He is able to do exceeding abundantly above what we ask or think;</hi> and not only above what we actually ask and think, but indeed, beyond what poſſibly we can ask or think, above what we are able to ask or think. Therefore let us never be diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged in prayer, becauſe of the greatneſs of the things that we have to ask of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Be not diſcouraged, though as your wants, ſo your dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and your troubles are great. How great ſoever the danger is you would be delivered from, God is greater, to whom you come for deliverance: And therefore when a great Mountain ſtood in the way of the deliverance of the people of God (<hi>Zech.</hi> 4.7.) the Prophet ſpeaks in his language, <hi>Who art thou? O great Mountain, thou ſhalt become a Plain before Zerubbabel;</hi> that is, before the power of that God in whom <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> truſts and whoſe work <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubbabel</hi> carries on. Hence that holy confidence (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.3.) <hi>Through the greatneſs of thy power, thine enemies ſhall ſubmit themſelves to thee,</hi> or, <hi>they ſhall yeild feigned obedience,</hi> as we put in the margin, which ſome render thus, <hi>through the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thy power, thine enemies ſhall be found liars.</hi> All the readi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> out againſt the great
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:48335:191"/> God. Therefore be not diſcouraged at any time at the greatneſs of danger. <hi>Though you walk through the very valley of the ſhadow of death</hi> (that's to be in the greateſt danger) yet as <hi>David</hi> did not, ſo do not you fear, no not that great danger, while the great God is with you.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Be not d ſcouraged though your ſins are great when you come to a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>k the pardon of them.</hi> As the greatneſs of ſin puts a very great damp upon the ſpirit of man in asking pardon, ſo the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God ſhould take off that damp. <hi>My thoughts are not your thoughts</hi> (ſaith the Lord <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.7, 8, 9.) in this matter. There is nothing wherein God doth more exceed man than in pardoning ſin (<hi>Mic.</hi> 7.18.) If ſin be great, the mercy of God is great too, infinitely greater than the ſin of man; if ſin be great, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member we have <hi>a great high Priest (Heb.</hi> 4.14.) not only a Prieſt, but a high Prieſt, and a great high Prieſt; therefore fear not to ask the pardon, even of the greateſt ſin, in his name and for his ſake. And this is true it we reſpect either national or perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſins; it may encourage us in asking pardon for nations, how great ſoever their ſins are. <hi>Moſes,</hi> when the People had greatly ſinned againſt God, had recourſe to this (<hi>Numb.</hi> 14.18, 19.) <hi>The Lord is of great mercy; pardon I beſeech thee the iniquity of this people, according to the greatneſs of thy mercy, as thou hast for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given this people from Egypt even until now.</hi> Do thus alſo with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to perſonal ſins. <hi>David</hi> made the greatneſs of his perſonal ſin an argument to go to God for mercy (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.11.) <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don my ſin, O Lord, for it is great.</hi> He was ſo far from being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartened by the greatneſs of his ſin, to a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>k the pardon of it, that (according to our reading) he had great hope of pardon, as well as ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>w he had great need of pardon; and all becauſe he knew God was great in mercy. Or, if we read that text thus, <hi>Pardon my ſin, O Lord, though it be great,</hi> the ſenſe is much the ſame; for as the former makes the greatneſs of his ſin a reaſon provoking him to haſten unto God for pardon (as great diſeaſes haſten us in ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing remedies) ſo the latter ſhews that the greatneſs of ſin is no ſtop to the mercy and free grace of God in Chriſt, for the pardon of it. Chriſt in that Parable (<hi>Mat.</hi> 18.24.) gives inſtance of the greateſt debt; he tells us of one that owed his Lord <hi>ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand talents,</hi> a vaſt ſum, a very vaſt ſum; a talent being, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the loweſt computation, three hundred pounds of money;
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:48335:191"/> ten thouſand times three hundred pounds is a huge ſum; ſo that here was a great debt, now (ſaith the text) <hi>When the debtor had nothing to pay, he came to his Lord, or Creditor, and he forgave him all.</hi> He did not ſay, wouldeſt thou have me, or can I, forgive ſuch a debt as this? What, ten thouſand talents? He forgave it as if it had been a debt of two mites. Thus, and many other wayes we may improve this firſt Attribute of God, mentioned in the text, <hi>his greatneſs,</hi> both as to our direction in duty, and conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in every extreamity. <hi>Behold God is great,</hi>
                     <q>And we know him not.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That's the ſecond thing. The words are plain, but the tenſe is difficult; for it may be objected, Do not we know God? <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaid but juſt now, in the very verſe before the text, <hi>Magnifie his works which men behold, every man may ſee it, man may behold it afar off?</hi> Surely if the works of God may be known and ſeen by every one, God himſelf may be known, for he is known in his works, as the Apoſtle argues (<hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20.) The things which he hath made make him known: how is this then ſaid, <hi>That God is great and we know him not?</hi> Doth not the Prophet in denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing that dreadful curſe (<hi>Jer.</hi> 10.25.) <hi>Poure out thy wrath up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hen that know thee not,</hi> thereby intimate, that all the people of God know him? Doth not Chriſt tell us (<hi>John</hi> 17.3.) <hi>This is eternal life, to know thee the onely true God.</hi> They who have eternal life, muſt have the knowledge of the true God. But all true believers have eternal life already in hope, and ſhall have it ſhortly in hand, therefore they know God. The Promiſe of the New Covenant is (<hi>Heb.</hi> 11.) <hi>They ſhall all know me from the leaſt to the greatest;</hi> that is, all my Covenant-people ſhall know me. How is it then ſaid, <hi>God is great, and we know him not?</hi> When <hi>Paul</hi> was at <hi>Athens,</hi> he ſound an Altar with that Inſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>To the unknown God (Act.</hi> 17.23.) They worſhipped a God whom they knew not, but certainly we muſt know whom we wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. <hi>Ye worſhip ye know not what,</hi> was Chriſt's reproof of the <hi>Samaritans</hi> (John 4.22.) <hi>We know what we worſhip;</hi> that is, whom we worſhip.</p>
                  <p>For anſwer to this, when the text ſaith, <hi>God is great and we know him not;</hi> we may ſay, Firſt, That even heathens, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taught, untutored, and uncatechized heathens do, or, may know
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:48335:192"/> God, that is, they may know him in ſome degree or other, they may, yea, they do know him (as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20.) ſo far as to leave them <hi>without excuſe;</hi> they have no plea, nor can they make any apologie for themſelves. Secondly, 'Tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, all believers, I mean all true believers, know God ſavingly, or ſo far as is ſufficient for their ſalvation. Every believer knows God. There is no faith in God without the knowledge of God. Thirdly, Which ſhall be the point of Obſervation from this part, as well as an anſwer to the queſtion;
<q>None know God fully, perfectly, comprehenſively.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That's <hi>Elihu's</hi> meaning when he ſaith, <hi>God is great, and we know him not;</hi> that is, we know not how great he is, or we know not the utmoſt of his greatneſs. God only knoweth himſelf fully and comprehenſively. There is no proportion between the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God and the underſtanding of a man. The greatneſs of God is infinite, the underſtanding of a man is but finite and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited; the deepeſt underſtanding among men, yea, the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of Angels is but ſhallow, compared with God. Thus we are to underſtand this text, <hi>God is great, and we know him not.</hi> There is a greatneſs in every thing of God, tranſcending the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of any created underſtanding. This ſome give for the reaſon, why the Seraphims ſpoken of (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.) are ſaid <hi>with two of their wings to cover their faces,</hi> they were not able to bear the light of the knowledge of the glory of God. For, though Chriſt, in that admonition which he gave, to take heed of off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>and deſpiſing</hi> the little ones, gives this reaſon for it. (<hi>Mat.</hi> 18.10.) <hi>For in heaven there Angels do alwayes behold the face of my Father which is in heaven;</hi> though (I ſay) it be a truth, that the holy Angels, and bleſſed Saints above, do alwayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the face of God, yet neither Saints nor Angels, not the Saints in glory, nor the glorious Angels, can fully comprehend the greatneſs and majeſty of God; and therefore the Prophet (as was ſaid) repreſented the Angels covering their faces with their wings. We have heard of King <hi>Hiero</hi> putting the queſtion to <hi>Simonides,</hi> a Philoſopher, <hi>What God was,</hi> who deſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed (not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to give a ſudden anſwer) that the King would reſpit him till next day; when next day came he deſired a ſecond, and when that came he deſired a third; and ſtill the more he ſearched,
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:48335:192"/> the farther he was from finding his anſwer. This is true, not only of Philoſophers, who ſee but by the dark light of Nature, but of thoſe who are enlightened divinely, or from above, they who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive much light from God, cannot comprehend the light of God; the more they ſearch into it, the more they ſee themſelves ſhort of it. The moſt we know of God is not ſo much as the leaſt part of that which we know not of him; and when we know as much of God as is knowable by man, yet it may be ſaid, as in the text, <hi>God is great, and we know him not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence take three brief Corolaries or Deductions.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, If God be great and <hi>we know him not,</hi> that is, we are not able to comprehend him; then we muſt reſt ſatisfied with what God hath manifeſted of himſelf and of his will. God hath manifeſted himſelf theſe four wayes. Firſt, In his Word. Secondly, In his works of Creation and Providence. Thirdly, In his Son. Fourthly, By his Spirit. Theſe wayes God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to manifeſt himſelf, or make himſelf known unto his People; now what knowledge of God can be gathered up in theſe wayes, what can be learned of him out of his word, out of his works, by conſidering him in his Son, and by waiting for the help of his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Spirit, we muſt labour to take in; but take heed of a bold preſſing into the ſecrets of God, or of a curious prying into the nature of God, which indeed will but dazle our eyes, and the more we think or look into it, the blinder we ſhall be.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If God be ſo great that we know him not, <hi>Then we ought not preſumptuouſly to enquire into a reaſon of the works and wayes of God;</hi> for that which is true of God himſelf, is true of his works and of his wayes, we cannot know them in the ſence opened: Therefore the Apoſtle ſpeaking about that wonderful diſpenſation of God, the laying aſide of the <hi>Jewes</hi> and calling of the <hi>Gentiles (Rom.</hi> 11.33.) cryeth out, <hi>O the depth of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and wiſdom of God! how unſearchable are his Judgments, and his wayes paſt finding out!</hi> As God himſelf cannot be fully known, ſo neither can his wayes nor works.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If God cannot be fully known, neither in himſelf, nor in his works, <hi>Then take heed of murmuring or complaining of the wayes, works, and dealings of God.</hi> Will you find fault with that which you neither do, nor can fully know? how little is it of any of the works of God, that we know! how little a way do we
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:48335:193"/> ſee into them! let us not find fault with that thing, the perfections whereof we cannot find out; ſay not, why is it thus? why doth God let things go thus? why are his providences ordered thus? there are many ſuch queryings in the hearts of men, and ſome ſuch are expreſt by the tongues of men. But remember the Lord can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be known in his works, therefore let us not complain of his works, but, ſitting down in ſilence, ſubmit to them; let us (as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid) Be dumb becauſe God hath done it,</hi> (Pſal. 39.9.) <hi>David</hi> was ſilent, not only with reſpect to the ſoveraignty of God, who, he knew, had power and liberty to do whatſoever he pleaſed, but with reſpect to his incomprehenſibility, becauſe he knew he was not able to know or underſtand the bottome-reaſon of that which God had done. This ſome conceive, the ſpecial intendment of <hi>Elihu</hi> in this Text, as reproving <hi>Job</hi> for his many complaints, and murmurings, and diſputings about the dealings of God with him in the extremity of his ſufferings: Therefore, ſaid he, <hi>Conſider God is great, and we know him not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet let none be diſcou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aged in ſeeking after the knowledge of God, becauſe 'tis told us we cannot know God; yea let no man think to excuſe himſelf in his neglect of purſuing the knowledge of God, becauſe this Text ſaith we cannot know him. Some poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly will ſay, If God be ſo great, that we cannot know him, then why ſhould we labour after the knowledge of God? or we hope this will excuſe us, if we do not know him, ſeeing we cannot. Take heed of ſuch reaſonings; for though God cannot be known to the utmoſt of what himſelf is, yet God may be known ſo far as is needfull for us, and that is very far.

And this eternity or everlaſtingneſs of God, though it be impartible, yet it hath, I may ſay, a double reſpect: Firſt, to what went before; Secondly, to what is to come. The eternity of God is ſuch as cannot be ſearched out, either as to what is paſt, or to what is to come;<note place="margin">Aeternitas tempora omnia ſine tilla ſucc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> indeed unto God there is nothing paſt or to come; for eternity, properly taken, is an <hi>everlaſting Now,</hi> it is not that which paſſeth or moveth away; and therefore ſome of the Ancients elegantly deſcribe eternity, <hi>to be the perfect enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of bleſſed life all at once;</hi> which becauſe it is all at once to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and perfect, cannot be altered nor leſsned. In eternity that which is paſt is preſent, yea that which is to come is preſent in an eternal bleſſed life. 'Tis ſo with God, and ſo in proportion with all thoſe who are entred into eternity, whatſoever they have had is alwayes preſent with them, nor are they in the expectation of any thing to come; they enjoy all in every moment, without the want of any thing. 'Tis much more ſo with God; though years have ſucceſſion, yet the years of God have no ſucceſſion of times or things.</p>
                  <p>Further, The eternity of God, which lies under this deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>The Number of his years cannot be ſearched out,</hi> is not a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular attribute of God, but that which difuſeth it ſelf through all his attributes; he is eternall in all; there is no ſearching out the Number of the years of any of the perfections of God; his Wiſdome is eternal, and his Power is eternal, and his Goodneſs is eternal, and his Juſtice is eternal; there is no ſearching out <hi>the Number of the years of God</hi> in any of theſe perfections.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note;
<q>God is an eternal being;</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>His years come not under account, or number. God is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, not only without end, as created Spirits are, but without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, which no creature is, not can be; He is eternal, not only without end or beginning, but without ſucceſſion or mutation. Some of the Ancients tell us,<note place="margin">—Stabiliſ<expan>

                  <pb n="379" facs="tcp:48335:194"/>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>All things are alwayes preſent with or before God:</hi> Things paſt, things to come are preſent with God, he were not eternal elſe. In that eternity or eternal eſtate of glory which believers ſhall at laſt arive unto, even they ſhall enjoy all at once, becauſe all their enjoyments ſhall be in God, or God ſhall be their whole enjoyment.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>God is infinitely happy and bleſſed.</hi> He hath all that ever he had, or that ever he can have, all at once, or already, nothing of his bleſſedneſs is either to come to him or gone from him; therefore he muſt needs be infinitely bleſſed. Here in this world ſome men have had a kind of bleſſedneſs, they have been rich and great, they have been in power, they have had their fill of pleaſure, but now they have it not, all is periſhed and gone and paſt away. There are others in expectation of great matters, of great riches, of great honours, of great contentments in this world, but as yet they have them not; we ſay of many, <hi>Their lands are not come into their hands,</hi> their eſtate is but yet in reverſion and expectation. Thus it is with men; ſome have had it, and it is gone, and others though they may have it, yet it is not come. But now with the Lord all is preſent, and therefore how infinitely happy is he! A man would think himſelf very hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py if he could have all the contentments that ever he had ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red through the ſeveral dayes and years of his life gathered into one moment; it is thus with God, and thus in proportion it ſhall be with us, when we come to that bleſſed ſtate of eternity.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If God be eternall, if there be no ſearching out of his years, then</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Time is in the diſpoſe and ordering of God.</hi> He <hi>that inhabiteth eternity, is the Lord of time.</hi> God is ſaid to <hi>inhabite eternity, (Iſa.</hi> 57.15.) that is, he is eternall, and therefore he is the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer of all times; he that made time will order time: he order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth time as to perſons, and he orders time as to Nations, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders times, and all the changes of times, he ordereth, not only the duration of time, but the condition of times; all is from him, whoſe yea s cannot be ſearched out. <hi>David</hi> ſaid (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.15.) <hi>My times are in thy hands,</hi> that is, my perſonal times in all the changes of them, troubleſome or comfortable, joyfull or ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, are ordered at thy will, by thy power and wiſdome. And with reſpect to Nations <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaid (<hi>Chap</hi> 2.21.) <hi>He changeth times
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:48335:195"/> and ſeaſons.</hi> The Lord puts a new face of things upon S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>re among the ſons of men? The reaſon of all is, he is eternall.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, If there be no ſearching out the number of the years of God, if he be eternall, then</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>How ought we to reverence and adore God!</hi> We have a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from God to reverence thoſe who have attained many years in this world, which alaſs are very few, none at all to the years of God; the aged, the gray-headed muſt be reverenced, (<hi>Lev.</hi> 19.32.) And one reaſon of that Law may be, becauſe the aged have ſome ſhadow of Gods eternity upon them; they who have many years have ſome reſemblance of him, the number of whoſe years cannot be ſearched out; therefore God will have them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenced. Now if the ancient are to be reverenced, how much more God himſelf, who is called (<hi>Dan.</hi> 7.9.) <hi>The ancient of dayes!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, If God be eternall, then, <hi>we may truſt him, yea there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ought to truſt him,</hi> (Pſal. 74.12.) <hi>Thou art my King of old, commanding deliverances.</hi> O how did <hi>Davids</hi> confidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe upon this, that God who was King of old, is King now, and will be King for ever, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.16.) <hi>The Lord is King for ever and ever; the Heathen are periſhed out of his Land,</hi> that is, they ſhall ſurely periſh. God will not alwayes bear with evill men in his Land; For if becauſe God was King of all the Lands, he therefore drave the old Heathen out of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and planted his people there; doubtleſs, if they who bear the name of his people there, live ſo like the old Heathen that they may be called Heathen, he will alſo cauſe them to periſh out of his Land, and all becauſe <hi>he is King for ever and ever,</hi> and therefore can do it at one time as well as at another, and now as eaſily as at any time heretofore. <hi>Truſt in the Lord for ever, for in the Lord Jehovah is everlaſting ſtrength,</hi> (Iſa. 26.4.) <hi>David</hi> a Great Prince makes it an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to draw off our truſt from men, from the greateſt men, from Princes, becauſe they are not for ever, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 146.3, 4.) <hi>Trust not in Princes, nor in any Children of men;</hi> why not? many reaſons may be given why not; but the only reaſon there given is their frailty, and the conſequents of it; <hi>His breath goeth forth,</hi> &amp;c. As if he had ſaid, Suppoſe Princes are never ſo good, and juſt, and gracious in the exerciſe of their Power, yet truſt not in them,
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:48335:195"/> for they die, <hi>their breath goeth forth, and then all their thoughts pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh:</hi> all the reall purpoſes which they had, as alſo the promiſes which they made for your good, die with them, and can do you no good: The number of their years may be ſearched our, and run out, their years are not for ever. Now the contrary of that which is an argument uſed by the Spirit of God to draw off our truſt from the gods here on Earth, is an argument to draw on and engage our truſt ſtrongly to the God of Heaven; <hi>His breath goeth not forth, none, not one of his thoughts ſhall periſh;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore truſt in him.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, If there be no ſearching out the number of the years of God, then, <hi>Be not troubled if God ſeem to ſtay and not to do the work which you expect this or that year:</hi> If God doth it not this year, he hath another year to do it in, there is no ſearching out the number of his years. We may ſay of any man if he doth not his work this year, he may be gone before the next: but if God doth not his work this year, he may do it next year, or two or ten years hence; he hath time enough, even all time before him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore the Prophet, having ſaid (<hi>Hab.</hi> 2.3.) <hi>The viſion is for an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time, but at the end it ſhall ſpeak and not lie,</hi> preſen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ly adds, <hi>Though it tarry, wait for it:</hi> As if he had ſaid, The Lord who hath all times and ſeaſons in his power, will do his work in the beſt time and ſeaſon, he will do what he hath promiſed, when it is moſt ſit to be done; if he doth it not at the time when we expect, yet let us wait, he is the Maſter of time. God who is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, cannot be ſcantied of time, <hi>The number of his years can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſearched out.</hi> 'Tis a known maxime among the wiſe men of the world, <hi>Take time, and you may do any thing.</hi> What cannot God do, who knoweth all times, and can take what time he will!</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, Which followeth upon the former, <hi>God will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on his deſignes through all the world:</hi> He will carry them through, againſt all, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 92.8, 9.) <hi>Thou Lord art moſt high for evermore; Lo, thine enemies ſhall periſh;</hi> thine enemies who would hinder thy work, they ſhall certainly fall. Chriſt is called <hi>The firſt and the laſt; He</hi> (ſaith St <hi>John,</hi> Rev. 1.17.) <hi>laid his right hand upon me, and ſaid, fear not, I am the firſt and the last:</hi> Why ſhould he not fear? what did Chriſt offer to cure him of his fear? Chriſt doth not give him a bare diſſwaſive, <hi>Fear not,</hi> but a
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:48335:196"/> rational ground why he ſhould not fear. Fear will not be blown away with a breath: Our paſſions are never truly quieted nor attempered but by reaſon. Upon what ground then would Chriſt take off <hi>Johns</hi> fear, even upon this in the Text, <hi>I am the first and the last.</hi> As if he had ſaid, <hi>John</hi> why doeſt thou fear? knoweſt thou not who I am, what a Lord and Maſter thou ſerveſt? Why, <hi>John,</hi> I tell thee, I am <hi>the firſt and the laſt;</hi> and therefore thou mayeſt be ſure, I will do my work, and none ſhall lett me. <hi>John</hi> had wonderfull things in viſion; ſhall all theſe be done thought he? yea, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Fear not,</hi> I will carry on my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes (all the deſignes that Chriſt had in the world were then in viſion) Eternity triumphs over all difficulties; The Eternall will ſee the laſt man born, (as we ſay) he will have the laſt word, and the laſt blow. <hi>I am the first and the last.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, From this Conſideration of God, let us take a proſpect of our ſelves, what poor ſhort-lived ſhort-breathed Creatures we are. There is no ſearching out the number of the years of God, but we may quickly ſearch out the number of our own years; our life is but a ſpan long, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.5.) yea our age is nothing before God. Did we conſider the eternity of God, what ſhould we judge of our ſpan-long life? we are ſaid to be of <hi>yeſterday.</hi> Some expreſſe man thus; <hi>He is yeſterday;</hi> as if he were not to day, but were already paſt while he is. The beſt that can be ſaid of him is this; he is <hi>but of yeſterday,</hi> and poſſibly he ſhall not have a to morrow: but the Lord is for ever and ever the ſame.</p>
                  <p>And though we are ſhort-lived as to this world, though our years may ſoon be told over, yet let us remember that God hath called us to the participation of eternity; though we have not the eternity of God, which is without beginning, yet we ſhall have an eternity from God without end; every man is everlaſting as to his ſoul. The godly ſhall be bleſſed for ever; and there is an eternal eſtate of wo and miſery to the wicked, the number of the years of their ſorrows and ſufferings, who live and die without Chriſt, cannot be ſearched out. The number of the years of the joy and bleſſedneſs, and reſt and happineſs, and tranquility of thoſe that believe, of thoſe that are faithfull, of thoſe that are godly, of thoſe that walk with and fear God, I ſay the number of the years of their joy and happineſs cannot be ſearched out nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. No man can number or tell how long-laſting the felicity of
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:48335:196"/> Saints ſhall be. As the number of the years of God cannot at all be ſearched out, ſo he hath given man as to his future eſtate a numberleſs number of years: And it were well if we who enjoy this life, and are dying every moment, would often conſider there is a life coming which will never die, the number of our years alſo in that ſenſe cannot be ſearched out.</p>

                     <hi>ELlihu</hi> having ſhewed the greatneſs of God himſelf, in the former verſe, proceeds to ſhew the greatneſs of his wo ks; he had done it before as to Civil Adminiſtrations, and the order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of humane affaires, in caſting down and lifting up the ſons of men; he doth it now in natural things, or in ordering the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of nature, ſtill in reference unto man. He deſcribes the greatneſs of the works of God aloft or above in the Aire and in the Clouds, as he had before deſcribed the greatneſs of his works here below on the Earth.</p>
                  <p>The whole remainder of <hi>Elihu's</hi> ſpeech in this Chapter and to the end of the 37th, is ſpent in a philoſophical diſcourſe about the Meteors, and thoſe various operations and changes that are wrought in the Aire; he diſcourſeth of Rain, of Thunder and Lightning, of Snow and Winds; from all which works of God in Nature, <hi>Elihu</hi> would convince <hi>Job</hi> of the Juſtice and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God (as well as of his power) which was his chief pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. He begins this philoſophical Lecture or Lecture of divine Philoſophy with the Rain, in the two verſes now read; and he mingles much of that matter in this and the following Chapter. He ſpeaks here, I ſay, of the Rain, which is a diſpenſation of God uſually both very profitable &amp; comfortable; what more profitable or more comfortable than the rain? It is alſo a diſpenſation of God ſometimes very dreadfull and hurtfull: The Lord ſends the very ſame Creature upon contrary ſervices, ſometimes for good, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for evill; a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

'Tis high preſumption to uſe either ſubtraction from, or addition to the word of God.

                     </note> God raiſeth vapours from the earth, and then watereth the earth with them. All the rain which falls upon the earth was raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the earth. If I were to anſwer that queſtion in nature, <hi>What is Rain?</hi> I might reſolve it thus; <hi>Rain is the moiſture of the earth, drawn up by the heat of the Sun, into the middle Region of the Air, which being there condenſed into clouds, is afterwards at the will of God, diſſolved, and dropt down again in ſhowers.</hi> The Clouds, at the command of God, hold faſt, and at his command they break and let out their waters upon the earth. This is, as was toucht be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, a very ordinary, yet a very admirable work of God. As in ſpirituals, all thoſe acts of grace in faith, and love, and joy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by which our hearts and ſouls are carried up to heaven, come firſt from heaven; ſo that rain which comes down upon us from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:48335:199"/> was firſt fetched from among us by the mighty power of God. Rain, according to natural Philoſophy, is thus generated: The water and moiſture of the earth being attenuated by the heat of the Sun-beams, become vapours, which being ſo rarified and reſolved into an airy ſubſtance, are by the ſame heat of the Sun drawn up to the middle region of the air, where being again condenſed or thickened into water, they melt down into rain, at the appointment of God.</p>
                  <p>We may conſider rain briefly in all the cauſes of it; Thus:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The efficient cauſe of rain is God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The inſtrumental cauſe is the heat of the Sun.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The material cauſe is the moiſture of the Sea and watery Land.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The final cauſe of it, is, 1. Supream; the glory of God. 2. Subordinate; and that threefold. Firſt, the benefit. Secondly, the puniſhment. Thirdly, the inſtruction of man.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, From that other ſignification of the word, as it notes withdrawing or keeping back, upon which ſome inſiſt much,</p>
                  <p>Obſerve;
<q>God when he pleaſeth can with-hold the water or the rain.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He can give a ſtop to the rain, and then the clouds yeeld us no more water than a ſtone; <hi>He with-holds the drops of water.</hi> The Lord threateneth the Vineyard with this ſtop (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.6.) <hi>I will command the clouds, that they rain no rain upon it;</hi> which is true of a natural and proper Vineyard, and of proper natural rain, though it be meant there of the people of God, whom he meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorically, or improperly, calleth his Vineyard; and the rain there intended, is the rain of inſtruction uſually falling upon them. Now as God doth often forbid the ſhowers of the word, that they fall no more upon a people, as he ſends forth a prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition to ſtop the ſpiritual rain; ſo he alſo ſtops and prohibits the natural rain (<hi>Amos</hi> 4.7, 8.) <hi>I have with-holden the rain from you, when there was yet three moneths to the harveſt; and I cauſed it to rain upon one city, and cauſed it not to rain upon another city; one piece was rained upon, and the piece whereupon it rained not wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: ſo two or three cities wandered unto one city to drink water, but were not ſatisfied.</hi> Thus in caſe of diſobedience to his divine
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:48335:200"/> Law, the Lord threatened to ſtop the common Law of nature, and to <hi>make the heavens braſs, and the earth iron (Deut.</hi> 28.23.) And when the heavens are braſs, that is, when they yeeld no more moiſture than braſs, then the earth is as iron, that is, it yeelds no more food for the ſuſtentation of man or beaſt, than a bar of iron doth. Such ſtops the Lord hath often put upon the courſes of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and can do again when he pleaſeth; though I believe he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did, nor ever will do ſo, but when highly diſpleaſed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked by the ſin of man.</p>
                  <p>Take two or three inferences from it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>If the rain or drops of water come not in their ſeaſon, let us acknowledge the hand of God.</hi> It is God that hath lockt up the clouds when-ever they are lockt up; God hath forbidden the clouds to let down their rain when-ever they with-hold it. Men and Devils can no more ſtop the rain than make it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>When we want rain, let us go to God for it.</hi> 'Tis the prerogative of God alone to help us in that ſtreight; and therefore the holy prophet ſends a chalenge to all other powers, or declares them diſabled for this help (<hi>Jer.</hi> 14.22.) <hi>Are there any among the vanities of the Gentiles that can cauſe rain, or can the heavens give ſhowers?</hi> neither the one nor the other can. The heavens cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of a drop, though they poſſeſſe a ſea of water. God muſt <hi>hear the heaven, before the heavens can hear the earth,</hi> that is, anſwer the neceſſities of the earth. And as the heavens cannot give man rain, ſo neither can the gods of mans making and placing there, ſuch are all the vanities or vain Idols of the Gentiles. The prophet having ſhewed us that theſe cannot, ſheweth us who can give rain in the next words, <hi>Art not thou he, O Lord, our God</hi> (ſurely thou art he) <hi>therefore we will wait upon thee, for thou haſt made all theſe things. Solomon,</hi> at the dedication of the Temple, puts this as one ſpecial caſe wherein they were to apply to God by prayer (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.35.) <hi>When heaven is ſhut up and there is no rain, becauſe they have ſinned againſt thee, If they pray,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>then hear thou in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> The prophet ſends the people in that exigent to God (<hi>Zec.</hi> 10 1.) <hi>Ask ye of the Lord rain, in the time of the later rain.</hi> As if he had ſaid, if ye would have rain you muſt ask for i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, and be ſure ye ask it of none but him; <hi>ask of the Lord.</hi> As it is God that gives out or with-holds the rain, ſo he gives it our or with-holds it at the voice of prayer. The Apoſtle ſaith of <hi>Elias (Jam.</hi> 5.17.) <hi>he was a man
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:48335:200"/> ſubject to the like paſſions that we are, and he prayed earneſtly that it might not rain, and it rained not on the earth, by the ſpace of three years and ſix months; and he prayed again, and the heavens gave rain.</hi> At hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> word the Lord ſtopt rain, and at his word he gave rain. Let us therefore confeſs that God is the author or father of the rain; <hi>He cauſeth vapours to aſcend from the ends of the earth, he maketh lightnings for the rain (Pſ.</hi> 135.7.) <hi>He covereth the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with clouds, he prepareth rain for the earth (Pſ.</hi> 147.8.) God covereth the heaven with clouds, by drawing up vapours from the earth, which are the matter of theſe clouds, and in thoſe clouds he prepares the rain, &amp; by the rain ſent down makes the graſs to grow upon the mountains. The encreaſe of vegetables is the effect of rain; God hath the rain in his power, and to acknowledge him in it is our duty.<note place="margin">

In times of drought many will ſay, We hope we ſhall have rain when <hi>the Moon changeth,</hi> or, when the <hi>Wind turns;</hi> now though there be ſomewhat in natu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Let us take heed of provoking the Lord; he can quickly ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="392" facs="tcp:48335:201"/> ſhowrs of heaven, and then (as to this Life) in how ſad a caſe are we! As the Lord hath not <hi>left himſelf without witneſs</hi> (namely of his goodneſs) <hi>in ſending rain and fruitful ſeaſons,</hi> ſo he can quickly leave a witneſs of his Juſtice, and diſpleaſure, or of his juſt diſpleaſure, by with-holding rain and (as a conſequent of that) fruitful ſeaſons from us. Were it only to have rain and fruitful ſeaſons, we ſhould take heed of diſpleaſing God. If a man had ſuch power as to with-hold rain from your land, you would take heed of di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>pleaſing him. How dangerous then is it to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke God, who cannot only with-hold the rain from your land, but can, as the Scripture ſaith, make the rain of your land <hi>to be powder and duſt (Deut.</hi> 28.24.) that is, give you powder and duſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of rain! When the rain is long with-holden the earth grows hard, and being much trodden or traveled on, duſty; this duſt being raiſed up by the wind, ſhall come down inſtead of rain, or that's all the rain which I will give you. The Lord hath our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral comforts in his hand, as well as our ſpiritual and eternal.</p>
                  <p>Further, As this with-holding of the rain ſometimes, ſo the hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of the rain at any time, ſhews the great power of God; to hold the water in the aire is the work of God as much as to with-hold it from the earth. The water is a heavy body, and all heavy things tend downward; is it not a wonder that ſuch a mighty weight of water ſhould hang in the aire, and be there held up? if it were not held there, it would not ſtay there, but come down and drown all. What holds it up? the Cloud is a thin ſubſtance, yet it holds the water as well as the ſtrongeſt veſſel bound with hoopes of iron; But by what power? doubtleſs by the power of God. The water hath no conſiſtence in it ſelf, it is a fluid ſlippery body, now what can hold the water that none of it leakes out, but the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of God? There are many millions of drops in one little cloud, and every drop is of it ſelf ready to ſlip away, yet the whole cloud yeelds no more water then a rock till God orders it. Let us contemplate the Almightineſs of God, who can hold ſuch a mighty body of water in the aire, or who (as <hi>Job</hi> ſpake, <hi>Chap.</hi> 26.8.) <hi>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Secondly, It is a work of divine wiſdom.

                  <p>Firſt, In that, as the rain is made of the vapour, ſo according to the vapour, or in proportion to the vapour, ſuch are the ſhowres of rain; Note;
<q>According to what is naturally received, returns are natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if the Clouds of Heaven return to man naturally accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that they receive from the Earth; how is man on earth bound morally, or in duty, to return according to what he receives from Heaven. Let us mind our <hi>accordings and proportions</hi> to the dealings and diſpenſations of God. The Clouds of the aire will condemn us, at leaſt witneſs againſt us, if we receive much, and return little. I paſſe this. Only here we may take notice of ſix things in Concatination one with another: Firſt, vapours are drawn up from the Earth: Secondly, they are made into watery Clouds: Thirdly, from thence they are ſent back to moiſten the Earth: Fourthly, the rain ſent down is proportionable to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour that went up: Fifthly, according to that proportion, the Earth is made more or leſſe fruitfull; plentifull rains cauſe or produce plentifull fruits ordinarily from the Earth, and little rains little fruits: Sixthly, and laſtly, man is nouriſhed and hath his outward Comforts encreaſed or leſſened in proportion to the fruits which the Earth bringeth forth, or to the fruitfulneſs of the Earth. All theſe things attend and depend upon one another. <hi>They pour down according to the vapour thereof,</hi> and God draws up
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:48335:203"/> in proportion to what himſelf purpoſeth they ſhall pour down. Thus we ſee, how God by the Sun draws out the moiſture and ſap of the Earth, to return it back with advantage. Drawing up the moiſture makes the Earth languiſh, and her fruits wither; ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it down again, makes the Earth green, flouriſhing and fruitful. <hi>They pour down rain,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>Hence Note, Firſt;
<q>The Lord haih rain enough in ſtore;</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He hath veſſels plentifully filled for the watering of the Earth; and, <hi>The Lord is ſo free in his diſpenſation of the rain,</hi> that as he gives it to many in number, ſo to many in kind, he maketh his rain to fall, (as well as his Sun to ſhine) <hi>upon the juſt, and on the unjuſt, (Math.</hi> 5.45.) It ſhews the exceeding goodneſs, as well as the bounty of God, that the evill partake of his benefits as well as the good.</p>
                  <p>And, for our further improvement of this bounty of God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that if God be ſo abundant and liberall in bleſſings to us, we ought in proportion to abound in duty towards him, or (as the Apoſtle exhorts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.58.) we ſhould be <hi>ſtedfaſt and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable, alwayes abounding in the work of the Lord.</hi> Some do only a little, (I may ſay) only here a ſtitch and there a ſtitch of work for God, but we ſhould abound in it; and that not only now and then by fits, but be alwayes fixed in it, eſpecially we ſhould do ſo, with reſpect to that, which the rain is a Symbol of, the word of God. When God drops and diſtills the rain of Goſpel t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>uths and holy ſoul-ſaving inſtructions abundantly upon us, how ſhould we abound in every good word and work! It was propheſied of Chriſt (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.6.) <hi>He ſhall come down as rain upon the mown graſs, as ſhowers that water the earth.</hi> Some of the Ancients ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound that place of the coming down of Chriſt in his Incarnation; then indeed he came down like rain upon the mown graſs, he came down ſweetly and powerfully. 'Tis true alſo that Chriſt, who is God, the Word, the ſubſtantial Word, comes down as rain in and with the declarative word of God preached and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully diſpenced to the ſouls of men: and when Chriſt comes down thus to us, we ſhould riſe up to him, and return fruits of grace, according to the ſhowres of grace, which we have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. The Prophet gives us an elegant compariſon of the natural and ſpiritual rain in their effects and iſſues, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.10, 11.) <hi>For as the rain cometh down and the ſnow from heaven, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give feed to the ſower, and bread to the eater; ſo
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:48335:204"/> ſhall my word be, that goeth forth out of my mouth; it ſhall not return unto me voyd, but it ſhall accompliſh that which I pleaſe, and it ſhall proſper in the thing whereto I ſend it.</hi> Now what is the pleaſure of God in giving his Word? what is the arrand upon which he ſends it? 'Tis I grant, ſometimes to harden, deafen and blind a people, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.9, 10.) 'tis ſometimes to be a ſavour of death unto death, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16.) Theſe are dreadfull judiciary pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of God in ſending his Word; nor doth it ever pleaſe the Lord to ſend his Word upon this arrand, but when he is ſorely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed by a peoples ſlighting and contempt of his Word.

                     </gap>ſueth in ſending his Word, is, that his people may have (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) <hi>Their fruit unto holineſs in this life, and in the end everlaſting life.</hi> For theſe ends, the Lord is daily diſtilling upon us the rain of his Word, both in commands and promiſes, and in both abundantly. Therefore let us labour to abound in returns of faith, of love, of hope, of ſelf-deniall, of zeal for God, and of fruit-bearing unto God. If when God diſtills the natural rain, that ſhould provoke us to fruitfulneſs in ſpiritualls, how much more when he pours down ſo much ſpiritual rain upon us! For the cloſe of this meditation, conſider, That</p>
                  <p>As the natural rain, Firſt, ſoftens the earth, and mollifies it; Secondly, cleanſeth the earth, and waſheth it; Thirdly, enricheth the earth, and makes it fruitfull; Fourthly, comforts the earth, and makes every thing that moves upon it, and grows out of it, to rejoyce; Fifthly, ſometimes drowns the earth, and deſtroys the Inhabitants of it: As I ſay, the natural rain doth all theſe things, ſo alſo doth the ſpiritual rain, the word of God.

The clouds are not all of a likeneſs, nor all of a bigneſs; there are clouds of many ſorts and ſizes: there are clouds which breed ſnow, and clouds which breed haile, clouds which breed raine, and clouds which breed thunder and lightning. Some clouds are empty, called clouds <hi>without raine</hi> or <hi>water, (Pro.</hi> 25.14. <hi>Jude,</hi> v. 12.) and other clouds are full of water: There is a difference alſo of clouds as to our ſight and view, ſome are black, ſome white, ſome red, ſome are greeniſh, others paliſh clouds, from which various colours and appearances, Prognoſticks are made of the change of weather, as Chriſt told the Phariſees (<hi>Mat.</hi> 16.2, 3.) Naturaliſts obſerve very many differences in the clouds, nor is it without wonder, that the clouds which are made all of one matter (vapours drawn from below) ſhould produce ſuch and ſo many different effects, that (according to this reading) we have reaſon to put the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, <hi>Who can underſtand the differences of the Clouds?</hi> We read it, and that well and full to the Hebrew Text,

                  <p>Now becauſe <hi>Elihu</hi> is upon a work of nature, and inſiſts upon it all along in the next Chapter; I ſhall therefore to clear the matter, propoſe and anſwer three Queſtions concerning the Clouds.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, What is a Cloud, or what is the nature of the Clouds? <hi>A cloud is a moist vapour drawn up from the earth or water by the heat of the Sun into the middle region of the Aire</hi> (as Naturaliſts di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the Aire) <hi>where being by the coldneſs of the place congealed, and as it were knit together, it hangeth and continueth there, till it be broken up at the diſpoſe of God, and ſent down for the comfort or correction of man in raine, ſnow, haile,</hi> &amp;c. The clouds of heaven derive their pedigree from the moiſture found on earth, and to the earth they return their moiſture.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Seeing the Clouds are ſuch mighty bodies, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain (as I may ſay) whole ſeas of water in them, and water, being a heavy body, naturally deſcends or tends downward (as all heavy things do) it may be queſtioned (and indeed it is a wonder) how thoſe Clouds are k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>pt aloft in the Aire? how comes it to paſs that ſuch heavy bodies, ſuch floods of water do not preſently fall violently, and at once ſhed themſelves down upon, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelme the earth? To that I anſwer,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Some ſay the Clouds are kept up by that natural inbred heat or warmth which is included in them; or that they are kept up by the ſuperiour heat of the Sun, and Stars, which firſt drew them up.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Others ſay, theſe mighty Clouds are held up by
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:48335:206"/> the wind; which keeping them in perpetual motion, they fall not, they deſcend no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, but according to a divine order, by which they are diſpoſed of to ſeveral uſes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Others aſcribe it to the hollowneſs or ſpungineſs of their nature, which receiving and taking in the thin aire, they are more eaſily kept up.</p>
                  <p>But when we have ſearched to the utmoſt for reaſons in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we muſt riſe higher, and reſolve the queſtion according to Scripture and divine Philoſophy, into the power and will of God. The holding up of the Clouds is Gods work as well as the raiſing of them up; He gave this law or command unto the Clouds in the day of their creation, that they ſhould not fall down nor diſtill a drop, but by his own commandement and appoyntment. Thus we find it expreſſed by <hi>Moſes</hi> in his deſcription of the crea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Thus there was a Law at firſt to keep quarter, as I may ſay, between thoſe waters. And <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaking of the eternal Son of God, of his co-eternity with the Father, brings him (under the name of Wiſdome) ſpeaking thus of himſelf; <hi>I was with him</hi> (when he did this and that, and among the reſt, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.28.) <hi>When he eſtabliſhed the Clouds above;</hi> that is, when God made a Decree that the Clouds ſhould ſtay above, and not come down but at his call. So 'tis expreſſed (<hi>Job</hi> 26.8.) <hi>God bindeth up the waters in the thick Cloud, and the Cloud is not rent under them.</hi> 'Tis not of it ſelf that the Cloud (having ſuch a weight in it) doth not rent and break, but, ſaith God, it ſhall not. (<hi>Pro.</hi> 30.4.) <hi>He hath bound the waters in a garment.</hi> But what is the garment? His own decree and pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>poſe is the garment which bindeth up the waters. For as the waters of the Sea are bounded by the Decree of God (<hi>Job</hi> 38.11.) So likewiſe the waters in the aire are bound up by his Decree (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 148.4, 6.) <hi>Praiſe him ye heaven of heavens, and ye waters which are above the heavens; he hath eſtabliſhed t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>em for ever, and hath made a decree which ſhall not
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:48335:206"/> paſs.</hi> He hath eſtabliſhed the waters which are above the heavens, aſwel as the waters below the heavens; he hath eſtabliſhed them by a decree (like that of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi>) which ſhall not be diſanulled. So then, here's the anſwer to this ſecond que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, How it comes to paſs, that the Clouds containing ſuch floods of water (which is an heavy body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) do not deſcend and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verwhelm the earth? This is by the power and decree, or by the powerful decree of God, who hath cauſed ſuch a weak and thin ſubſtance, as the Clouds, made up only of Vapours, to hold thoſe mighty waters cloſe, and keep them priſoners, that not a ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſhall ſhed forth till himſelf pleaſeth. The Clouds, as ſome have well expreſſed it, are like ſpunges filled with water, and till God layeth his hand upon the Clouds (that is, till he gives a word) and as I may ſay, ſqueezeth or preſſeth them by his providence (as we ſqueez a ſpung full of water) the waters fall not. Thus we ſee the reaſon, why <hi>Elihu</hi> makes ſo great a matter of the ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eading of the Clouds, and why the waters fall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently together, nor preſently drop out of them, but in their ſeaſon.</p>
                  <p>A third Querie concerning the Clouds may be this; <hi>Why are they placed above? What is their uſe?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, The uſe of the Clouds may be conſidered two ways; firſt, there is a natural, ſecondly, a ſpiritual uſe of them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, there is a natural uſe of them, and that is twofold.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That they may contain water in a readineſs to moiſten and fatten the earth: Stores and treaſures of rain are kept in them to ſupply the neceſſities of all earthly creatures.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The natural uſe of the Clouds is, to attemper the the heat of the air, and to be as a Curtain, or Screen between us and the Sun. If the Sun ſhould alwayes ſhine fully upon the earth, we were not able to abide it; but the Clouds coming between, do exceedingly qualifie and moderate the heat and fierceneſs of the Sun. Theſe, beſides others, are their natural u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es.</p>
                  <p>And if we look into the Scripture, we ſhall find many ſpiritual and gracious uſes, for which God hath made the Clouds.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, God hath ſet his Bow in the Clouds, as a token of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour unto mankind, as a token of his general favour, that he will not drown the world again (<hi>Gen.</hi> 9.14, 15.) <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs, when I bring a Cloud over the Earth, that the Bow ſhall be
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:48335:207"/> ſeen in the Cloud; and I will remember my Covenant which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween me and you, and every living creature of all fleſh; and the waters ſhall no more become a flood, to deſtroy all fleſh.</hi> This is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded to by the Prophet (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.9.) as a token of the ſpecial favour of God to his People, that he will never break Covenant with them. When Believers ſee his Bow in the Cloud, they may be as well aſſured, that they ſhall be freed from a deluge of wrath, as that the world ſhall not be overwhelmed again with a deluge of waters.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We find the Lord making uſe of a Cloud, or uſing the miniſtery of a Cloud, in a g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>acious way, for the conducting of his People out of <hi>Egypt</hi> quite through the Wilderneſs unto <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan.</hi> That I grant was more than an ordinary Cloud, and lower and nearer the earth than uſually Clouds are, yet it was doubtleſs of the ſame nature with other Clouds (<hi>Exod.</hi> 13.21. <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.19.) And therefore, when the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ophet would aſſure the Church of guidance and protection, he tells them (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.5.) <hi>The Lord will create upon every dwelling place of mount Sion, and upon her aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, a Cloud and Smoak by day, and the ſhining of the flaming Fire by night: for upon all the glory ſhall be a defence.</hi> And we at this day, may make this ſpiritual uſe (acco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ding to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) of the Clouds, which we behold, as to mind us how the Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d both protected and guided the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> through the wilderneſs, ſo to aſſure us that he will protect and guide us through the World. Chriſt is this Cloud, a covering protecting Cloud unto his Church; and we may ſweetly meditate upon him, not only when we behold the Sun, but as often as we behold the clouds.</p>
                  <p>Further, As Chriſt ſerves his Church like a Cloud, ſo the Clouds have done and ſhall do many ſervices to Chriſt. A b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

A Cloud received him out of the Apoſtles ſight at his aſcenſion (<hi>Act.</hi> 1.9.) and he ſhall come again in the Clouds to judgment <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.30. <hi>Luke</hi> 21.27.) He is alſo repreſented) ſitting upon a white Cloud (<hi>Rev.</hi> 14.14.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The ſpirit of God gives us another gracious uſe of, and meditation upon the Clouds; that as often as we ſee thick and black Clouds, which threaten a grievous ſto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m, ſcattered, and the air cleared, this ſhould put us in mind of the abundant grace
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:48335:207"/> of God pardoning our ſin (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.22.) <hi>I have blotted, as a thick Cloud, thy tranſgreſſion, and as a Cloud thy ſins.</hi> Falſe and faithleſs Miniſters are called <hi>Clouds without water (Jude v.</hi> 12.) And the faithful Miniſters of the Goſpel, <hi>flee as a Cloud</hi> to water Souls, as the converted Gentiles are ſaid, <hi>to flee as doves to the windows (Iſa.</hi> 60.8.) There are not only natural but ſpiritual uſes and improvements to be made of the Clouds, as often as we behold them; and the Scripture in many places, leads and points us to ſuch meditations. It is ſaid of <hi>Luther,</hi> that once beholding a great Cloud, that promiſed, or had a great appearance of rain, in a time of drought, blown away and diſpelled, without yeelding one drop of rain to refreſh the earth; he turned to ſome of his friends, and ſaid, <hi>Such are the Promiſes of the world.</hi> Men, ſaid he,<note place="margin">Tales ſunt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſiones mundi.</note> make great and fair promiſes, pretending much good, and good-will to thoſe to whom they are made, which yet vaniſh and come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and concluding his obſervation upon the deceitful appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Cloud, added the words of <hi>Solomon (Prov.</hi> 25.14.) <hi>Who ſo boaſteth himſelf of a falſe gift, is like clouds without rain.</hi> Such eſpecially are all falſe teachers, they, if any, boaſt themſelves of a falſe gift, that is, they either pretend to a gift which they have not, or they pretend their gift is of Chriſt, when it is not; theſe are <hi>like Clouds without rain,</hi> or (as the text in the Epiſtle of <hi>Jude,</hi> even now mentioned) calls them, they are <hi>Clouds without water, carried about of winds,</hi> that is, which way ſo ever the wind of outward reſpects and advantages bloweth, they are carried.</p>
                  <p>So much for anſwer to thoſe three queſtions about the Clouds. <hi>Who can underſtand the ſpreading of the Clouds?</hi>
                  </p>

Nor hath a natural man a clearer inſight in any other Goſpel myſtery (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14.) <hi>The natural man receiveth not the things of God, neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned.

And as this place of publick worſhip, ſo any place for private dwelling was called a tabernacle. <hi>Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my houſe, until &amp;c.</hi> (Said <hi>David, Pſ.</hi> 132.3.) that is, into my houſe, which though it be a royal Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, yet I look upon it, but as a movable tabernacle. But doth God dwell in a movable houſe? God is immovable, he makes no removes, yet whereſoever God is pleaſed to ſhew himſelf in his power and marvelous works, there we may ſay his tabernacle is. The tabernacle of God, where this noiſe, this mighty noiſe is made, is nothing elſe but the Clouds before ſpoken of. The
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:48335:209"/> Clouds are Gods tabernacle; they are called ſo expreſly by a word of very near cognation unto this (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.11.) <hi>He ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the Clouds his pavilion.</hi> A pavilion is an extraordinary taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle; a pavilion is that tabernacle which is proper to a King or to the General of an Army. Now ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>He maketh the Clouds his pavilion;</hi> In them he ſhews his power and glory. They are alſo called the chariots of God (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.3. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.6.) and he is ſaid to come in the Clouds, as a Prince in his chariot. He came <hi>in a thick Cloud (Exod.</hi> 19.9.) and he <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended in a Cloud (Exod.</hi> 34.5.) which here is called his taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle. So then, the Clouds, together with all that middle region of the air, where the rain now, and fiery meteors, are generated, are in Scripture allegorically called, the tabernacle of God; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there he ſeems often to dwell or reſide, for the producing of many wonderful works upon this inferiour world. We may take the word here in a double alluſion unto a tabernacle, or unto two ſorts of tabernacles.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, There were ordinary tabernacles, wherein men dwelt. The ancient Hebrews dwelt in tents or tabernacles; theſe were tabernacles for civil uſe, or for habitation; in alluſion unto which, the Apoſtle ſpeakes of the body, wherein the ſoul dwels (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.) <hi>When the earthly houſe of this tabernacle ſhall be diſſolved, we know, that we have a building of God, an hsuſe not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, There were tabernacles for military uſe, ſouldiers tents, or tabernacles. As the whole heavens, ſo the clouds eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially may be called the tabernacle of God in both reſpects; they a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Where-ever God works much, he is ſaid to dwell. Why is God ſaid to dwell with them that are of an humble and contrite heart? even becauſe he workes much in them, and much by them. So becauſe many great works of God are done in the Clouds, as we ſhall ſee more particularly hereafter, therefore the Lord is ſaid to dwell there as in his tabernacle.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, When 'tis ſaid, <hi>Who can underſtand the noiſe of his tabernacle?</hi>

God himſelf is <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>the Father of Lights (Jam.</hi> 1.17.) which is true not only of ſpiritual Light, by which the things of God are diſcovered to us; but alſo of natural Light, the light of the Sun, that's Gods Light too, he is the Father of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly note;
<q>The changes which we ſee in the air, from fair to fowl wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, from calms to tempeſts, are from God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is not in the creature to make one day or hour fair or foul. As Chriſt gives the reaſon why no man ſhould ſwear by his head, becauſe he cannot <hi>make an hair white or black,</hi> he cannot change the colour of an hair, nor make a hair of any colour: So, it is not in the power of any man, to make one day fair or foul, that's Gods peculiar; <hi>He ſpreadeth his Light upon the Clouds, and covereth the bottom of the Sea.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <bibl>
                        <hi>Verſ. 31.</hi>
                     </bibl> For by them he judgeth the People, he giveth meat in abundance.</q>
                  <p>This 31<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Verſe gives us the effect of all that which <hi>Elihu</hi> had ſpoken before, of the rain, of ſtorms and tempeſts, and we may add, of lightening, and of thunder; <hi>By them he judgeth the people and giveth meat in abundance.</hi> Here are two effects; Firſt, an effect grievous; Secondly, an effect gracious: The former proceeds from the juſtice, the latter from the mercy and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>By them,</hi> that is, by the rain, by the winds, <hi>&amp;c. he judgeth the people.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>To judge is taken three wayes in Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To judge, is to rule or govern. When it is ſaid, ſuch a man judged <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the meaning is, he ruled and governed <hi>Iſrael:</hi> That's the language of the book of <hi>Judges</hi> every where, when their Governours are ſpoken of.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To <hi>Judge,</hi> is to determine, or give ſentence in a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial caſe (<hi>Deut.</hi> 25.1.)</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, To judge is to puniſh or afflict, and thus often in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:48335:211"/> when God puniſheth any perſon or people, he is ſaid to judge them (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.4. <hi>That thou mayeſt be cleared when thou judgeſt,</hi> that is, when thou afflicteſt, or layeſt thine hand upon me (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) as God had threatened by <hi>Nathan,</hi> that the ſword ſhould not depart from his houſe; this moved <hi>David</hi> to make confeſſion, <hi>Againſt thee, thee only, have I ſinned: — that thou mighteſt be juſtified when thou ſpeakeſt, and cleared when thou judgest.</hi> As if he had ſaid, my confeſſion, O Lord, will be thy juſtification; all may ſee I have given thee abundant cauſe to lay thy chaſtening hand upon me (<hi>Heb.</hi> 13.4.) <hi>Whoremongers and adulterers God will judge;</hi> though men let them paſs, yet God will not, he will puniſh them. Again, in that notable place (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.31, 32.) <hi>If we would judge our ſelves we ſhould not be judged of the Lord.</hi> What it is to be judged, the Apoſtle ſheweth in the next words; <hi>But when we are judged, we are chaſtened of the Lord.</hi> The Apoſtle warns the Church to take heed how they came to the ſolemn aſſemblies, leſt coming raſhly and unpreparedly, the hand of God ſhould fall heavy upon them, by weakneſs, ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and death. When <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith, <hi>By them he judgeth the People.</hi> We are to take judging in this third ſence; <hi>He judgeth,</hi> that is, he afflicteth and puniſheth men by theſe things. Thus the Alluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is elegantly followed. The Lord from his tabernacle, or throne in the Clouds, ſends forth Edicts, and ſignes his Warrants, for the puniſhment both of nations and perſons; windy ſtormes, rain and thunder, going forth as executioners of his orders and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: <hi>By them he judgeth the people.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve;
<q>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> God can make a ſcourge of any of the creatures.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By them,</hi> that is, by the rain and by the wind, <hi>he judgeth the people.</hi> He can uſe what inſtrument he pleaſeth to afflict and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten us with. Read the holy Scriptures, read the Hiſtories of the Church, and you will find all ſorts of creatures ſummoned one time or other, and ſent forth as Gods meſſengers, to puniſh the pride and ſtubbornneſs, the impenitency and perverſneſs of mens hearts and wayes. How many creatures did God make uſe of to puniſh <hi>Pharaoh</hi> with, and many of them ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="413" facs="tcp:48335:211"/> King. Whenſoever God afflicts a people by the creatures, he judgeth them by the creatures. Let us take heed, that we provoke not God to turn thoſe things which were given for our good, to our hurt; that he make not what was made our ſervant, our puniſhment. God made all creatures ſerviceable and uſeful to man, but through ſin they become grievous and deſtructive to man; <hi>By them he judgeth the people.</hi>

                  <p>Secondly note;
<q>God is a free, bountiful and liberal houſe-keeper;</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He giveth meat in abundance; he giveth to very many, yea, to all, and he giveth very much; he giveth meat to all the fowles of the Air, and to all the fiſhes of the Sea, to all men and beaſts living on the earth, they all receive food from God: he giveth food to all fleſh (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 136.25.) <hi>He filleth every living thing.</hi> (Pſal. 147.9.) <hi>He giveth to the beaſt his food, and feedeth the young ravens when they cry.</hi> Chriſt makes this an argument of faith in God for food and cloathing (<hi>Mat.</hi> 6.26.) <hi>Behold the fowls of the air, for they ſow not, neither do they reap, nor gather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them: are not ye much better than they?</hi> How little faith have you, who knowing that God feeds the fowls of the air, yet cannot truſt him for your food! <hi>He giveth food in abundance.</hi>

                  <pb n="414" facs="tcp:48335:212"/>
                  <p>Thirdly note;
<q>Plenty and ſcarcity are at the diſpoſe of God;</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He can give meat in ſcarcity, as well as meat in abundance; he can give cleanneſs of teeth as well as fulneſs of bread: And as he can ſtrengthen the ſtaff of bread, ſo break it, and <hi>cauſe us to eat bread by weight and with care, and to drink water by meaſure and with aſtoniſhment</hi> (Ezek. 4.16.) To eat by weight and drink by meaſure, is to eat and drink in the want of bread and water, as is expreſſed (<hi>verſ.</hi> 17.) And as theſe changes of our natural, ſo of our ſpiritual food are from the Lord (<hi>Amos</hi> 8.11.) <hi>I will ſend a famine</hi> (What famine?) <hi>not of bread, but of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the word of the Lord.</hi> 'Tis the Lord who ſends plenty and ſcarcity of bread, whether for the ſoul or for the body.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, In that he ſaith, by them he giveth meat in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,</p>
                  <p>Note;
<q>God uſeth natural meanes as the cauſe either of plenty or ſcarcity.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lord could give us abundance, if he pleaſed, without rain, but he rarely gives abundance but by rain; he ſends rain out of the Clouds to water the earth, and make it fruitful. The Lord could make our ſouls fruitful in every good work, without the preaching of the word, but he ſeldom doth it (I believe never when the word may be had) without the preaching of the word. And therefore the Lord by his Prophet makes a compariſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween, or a paralel of theſe two (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.10, 11.) <hi>As the rain cometh down, and the ſnow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give ſeed to the ſower, and bread to the eater; ſo ſhall my word be, that goeth out of my mouth,</hi> &amp;c.

<pb n="415" facs="tcp:48335:212"/> of God in every ſhower of rain, and fleet of ſnow; for by them he giveth us our meat.</p>
                  <p>We ſhould hence alſo be minded to fear the Lord, and to take heed of his diſpleaſure. It is ſaid (<hi>Asts</hi> 12.20.) when <hi>Herod was highly diſpleaſed with them of Tire and Sidon, they came with one accord to him; and having made Blaſtus the Kings Chamberlain their friend, deſired peace, becauſe their Country was nouriſhed by the Kings Country.</hi> O how much more ſhould we labour to avoid the diſpleaſure of God, and haſten to make our peace with him, ſeeing our Country is nouriſhed by his Country! The heavens nouriſh the earth, elſe the earth could not afford any thing for our nouriſhment. We are fed rather from the heavens than from the earth. The clouds drop down and make the earth fat, to give graſs for cattel and co n for man. <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeaks nothing of the Earth, but of the Clouds, f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Lately conſider, <hi>Elihu</hi> joynes both effects expreſly, <hi>By them he judgeth the people, he giveth meat, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>The Lord can make the ſame creature either beneficial or hurtful to us.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That which is an inſtrument in his hand for good to his ſervants, is often a plague and a ſcourge to his enemies. The rain which at one time moiſtens the earth, at another time drowns it; the rain which at one time cheriſheth the creatures, at another time choaks them. The winds which at one time fan the air and cool it, at another time enrage and vex it; the winds which at one time ſweeten and cleanſe the air, at another time corrupt and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it. The Lord can with the ſame creatures, furniſh himſelf for any diſpenſation: <hi>By them he judgeth the people, and by them he giveth meat in abundance.</hi>

                  <p>The words (as I conceive) according to the mind of our tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlators, and as the Text clearly beareth, hold out two things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the raine, of which <hi>Elihu</hi> had ſpoken before.</p>

An Interceſſor cometh between two parties, the party offending, and the party offended, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſeth himſelf to make up the breach, or to take up the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that if poſſible a reconciliation may be made. The Latine word which we tranſlate Latinely to <hi>intercede,</hi> is of the ſame ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificancy; and this Hebrew word is often ſo rendred (<hi>Jer.</hi> 7.16.) <hi>Pray not for this people, nor make interceſſion to me;</hi> that is, thou ſhalt not come between me and this people to ſtop or ſtay me, that I break not out into wrath, or from pouring out my wrath upon them. In other Scriptures it is uſed to note an act of interceſſion between man and man (<hi>Gen.</hi> 23.8.) as alſo an act of addreſs by prayer and intreaty, whether towards God or man, (<hi>Job</hi> 21.15. <hi>Ruth</hi> 1.16.) And becauſe the word properly notes meeting another with a kind of violence, it intimates with what a holy violence, with what ſtrength, earneſtneſs, and ferven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of ſpirit, we ought to meet God, either in prayer for our ſelves, or when we come as interceſſors, and ſtand before him in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of others, whether Perſons, Nations, or Churches.</p>
                  <p>Many Interpreters (as I ſhall ſhew afterward) take the word in this ſence here for an Interceſſor, or for a perſon that prayeth and intercedeth for another. We, in our tranſlation, expound it of a thing, and that thing of a Cloud that interpoſeth or cometh between us and the Light.

As God can ſorbid the Light by interpoſing Clouds, ſo he can ſorbid the Clouds to give us ſhowers, and bind up all the ſweet influences of heaven from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilling upon the earth to make it fruitful. He can ſpeak to our garments that they warm us not, to our food that it nouriſh us not, to our phyſick that it cure and heal us not, to all our relations that they comfort us not, to all our poſſeſſions and riches that they content us not.

                  <p>Hence Note;
<q>God by natural ſigns gives warning of a change in natural things.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>When God is about to ſend rain, the noiſe that is in the Clouds tells the world that 'tis coming. Some are very skilful in obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe things; ſuch we call, <hi>weatherwiſe.</hi> From this I would only infer, If God doth fore-ſhew or give ſigns of the change that he makes in natural things, then ſurely he doth much more give his people warning of the changes he is about to make in civil things, in the States and Kingdomes of this world. There are ſome things which do, as it were, predict or fore-ſhew ſuch and ſuch changes neer, if we were wiſe to obſerve them. The <hi>Jewes</hi> were very inquiſitive to know of Chriſt the ſigns of the times; Theſe ſigns they enquired of him, not ſo much out of curioſity (which had been bad enough) as out of treachery, to int<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ap him in his words, yet mark what Chriſt ſaid to to them (<hi>Math.</hi> 16.1, 2, 3.3) <hi>He anſwered and ſaid unto them, when it is eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                     <pb n="425" facs="tcp:48335:217"/> (a red skie ſhewes concerning fair weather) <hi>and in the morning it will be foul weather, for the skie is red and lowring.</hi> When the skie lowres, or, as here in <hi>Job,</hi> when the Cloud cometh between us and the light, that tells us it will be foul weather. Now, ſaith Chriſt, do you think that God hath given us ſuch warnings about changes in natural things, and hath he not given ſigns which may fore-ſhew changes in other things, which more concerns us? Therefore Chriſt checks them in the 3d verſe, <hi>O ye hypocrites, ye can diſcern the face of the skie, and can ye not diſcern the Signs of the times,</hi> that is, what changes God will m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

A dreadful black Cloud of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction hung over the City of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> at that time, as Chriſt had fore-told them in ſeveral places of the Goſpel: the time is coming (ſaith he) when <hi>there ſhall not be left one ſtone upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> yet you cannot ſee the ſigns of theſe things; you are very skilful to diſcern a fair day &amp; a foul day (there are natural progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks of theſe things) but ye hypocrites cannot diſcern the ſigns of the times: Do ye not think God hath given you warning, hath he not fore-ſhewed what he will do with you and with this City? if ye were wiſe ye might unde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

God gives as clear ſigns of the changes that ſhall be in times, as he doth concerning the change of the weather: And that's one thing which doth very much fore-ſhew it, when God puts it into the hearts of his Miniſters unanimouſly to fore-warn approaching troubles.

Some way or other God
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:48335:218"/> hath alwayes ſhewed when theſe ſhowres were coming; and when a people grow weary of their warnings, when they grow more prophane and wicked under them, this is a ſure ſign, a fatal prognoſtick, that God is coming with a ſhowre of wrath, and is ready to pour down a ſtorm of vengeance upon them. And ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theſe warnings, both with reſpect to natural changes in the Air, and civil changes in the affairs of this World, argue the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful goodneſs of God, that he would have us prepare for all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations: He will not ſend a ſhowre of rain, but would have us prepared for it; and when he is about to ſend thoſe great ſhowrs of Judgment upon the world, he would have his people ready and prepared, and therefore by ſome means or other he tells them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand what is at hand.</p>

And therefore the prophet checks them (<hi>v.</hi> 8.) <hi>How do ye ſay, we are wiſe, and the Law of the Lord is with us?</hi> You count your ſelves very wiſe, yet ye are not ſo wiſe in this matter as the Stork and the Crane, and the Swallow, for they obſerve their times, but you do not. It is a great part of our wiſdom to ſee what God is doing, or what he is about to do before he doth it. It is ſaid (<hi>Prov.</hi> 22.3.) <hi>A prudent man foreſeeth an evil.</hi> When evil is come every one can ſee it (though ſome will ſcarce ſee it then, as the Prophet complained (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.11.) <hi>When thy hand is lifted up they will not ſee it</hi>) but uſually that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is done or doing we can ſee; when we feel an evil we can ſee it; but the prudent, that is the godly man, fore-ſeeth the evil. How comes he to fore-ſee it? not by any helliſh divination, not by ſtar-gazing, not by asking the Devil what ſhall be hereafter, as <hi>Saul</hi> did; he would fore-ſee the evil,

                  <p>Thirdly, He ſpeakes of the irrevocableneſs of Gods decrees and orders about them, at the 4th Verſe, <hi>After it a voice roareth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and he will not ſtay them when his voice is heard.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, He concludes about theſe and many other works of God, with an Elogie of all his works. Firſt, In their greatneſs; Secondly, In their incomprehenſibleneſs; or he concludes them, not only great, but wonderful and incomprehenſible (Verſ. 5.) <hi>God thundereth marvelouſly with his voice, he doth great things which we cannot comprehend.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having thus ſpoken of Thunder and Lightning, he proceeds,</p>

                  <p>Secondly, By their effects. Firſt, Towards men, in the 7th Verſe. Secondly, Upon or towards irrational Creatures, the Beaſts of the earth, at the 8th Verſe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He ſets forth the Power of God in the Winds, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which we have,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Their original, whence they come (Verſ. 9.)</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Their effects, or what they produce, cold and froſt, in the latter part of the 9th and 10th Verſes.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, He treats of the Clouds, and about them he declares four things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The melting or diſſolving of them into Rain, at the 11th Verſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The ſcattering and diſperſing of them by the wind, in the latter part of that Verſe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The diſpoſing and ordering of them by the counſel and command of God, at the 12th Verſe.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Their uſes, ends and operations, at the thirteenth Verſe.</p>
                  <p>Thus we have the firſt general part of the Chapter open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, containing a deſcription of the Meteors, or manifold works of God in the Air, all which hold forth and advance his mighty power and righteous adminiſtrations in this world, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:48335:221"/> the children of men; which was the poynt that <hi>Elihu</hi> had laboured in all along, and undertaken to demonſtrate.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond part of this Chapter, <hi>Elihu</hi> (upon the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) gives <hi>Job</hi> ſerious counſel and admonition, wherein,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, He ſtirs him up to conſider theſe wonderful works of God, at the 14th verſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He aſſerts and urgeth the weakneſs and inability of <hi>Job</hi> (or indeed of any man) to underſtand them fully; this he doth,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In general, at the beginning of the 15th verſe, <hi>Doſt thou know when God diſpoſed them?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, More particularly, in their ſeveral kinds.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Of the Clouds and their various motions, at the 16th verſe.</p>

                  <p>Fourthly, Of the Heaven or Skie (verſ. 18.)</p>
                  <p>All which were ſuch as he could not give a clear account of, and therefore at the 19th verſe, <hi>Elihu</hi> bids <hi>Job</hi> do it if he could, as for himſelf he durſt not venture upon it (verſe. 20.) nor can any (ſaith he verſ. 21.22.) ſee far into theſe natural things, or into the nature of theſe things. Theſe are the ſpecial poynts of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition to <hi>Job;</hi> and from theſe he paſſeth to the</p>

                  <p>Firſt, He makes a recapitulation of, or ſums up all that he had ſaid of the unſearchableneſs of God in his works; this he doth in the former part of the 23d verſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He ſets down poſitively what God is, in a three-fold Excellency.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Of Power.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Of Judgment.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Of plentiful Juſtice, at the middle of the 23d verſe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He tells us what God will not do, at the end of the 23d verſe, <hi>He will not afflict;</hi> and from all, makes two inferences at the the 24th verſe.</p>
                  <p>Fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, That therefore God is not in the reverence nor fear

                  <p>Thus I have given a proſpect of the whole Chapter. Now to particulars, beginning with thoſe two verſes by which <hi>Elihu</hi> leads in his diſcourſe of thoſe wonderful workes of God.</p>

                     <hi>At this,</hi> that is, by reaſon of this, or for this cauſe, or becauſe of this; ſo the word is rendred (<hi>Gen.</hi> 2.23.) <hi>She</hi> (ſaid <hi>Adam</hi> of his wife, or <hi>Second-ſelf) ſhall be called woman, becauſe ſhe was taken out of man.</hi> So here, at this, or for this cauſe, <hi>my heart trembleth.</hi> It may here be queſtioned, what it was at which the heart of <hi>Elihu</hi> trembled? I ſhall give a double anſwer to that querie.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Some conceive that while <hi>Elihu</hi> was ſpeaking about, or about to ſpeak further of that marvelous work of God, <hi>the Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> God, to confirm what he had ſaid, or ſhould ſay, at that very inſtant cauſed it to thunder, that ſo <hi>Job</hi> might be in a more humble reverential frame, and ſo the better prepared to receive what <hi>Elihu</hi> had further to ſay unto him. That there was a ſtorm at or about that time, may appear from the firſt verſe of the 38th Chapter; <hi>then the Lord anſwered Job out of the whirlwind, and ſaid;</hi> and we find that God hath often given great diſcoveries of himſelf in or by Thunder and Lightning. In Thunder and Lightning the Law was delivered to <hi>Moſes</hi> on mount <hi>Sinai (Exod.</hi> 19.6.) And to affect the peo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>le of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when they had provoked God by their peremptory and diſcontented way of asking a King, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> coming to deal with them about it (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.16, 17, 18.) ſaid, <hi>Stand and ſee this great thing, which the Lord will do before your eyes. Is it not wheat-harveſt to day? I will call unto the Lord, and he ſhall ſend Thunder and Rain, that ye may perceive and ſee that your wickedneſs is great. And the Lord ſent Thunder and Rain that day,</hi> even while <hi>Samuel</hi> was ſpeaking, for their conviction and humiliation, as the next words ſhew, <hi>and all the people greatly feared the Lord and Samuel.</hi> Thus poſſibly while <hi>Elihu</hi> was about to ſpeak of Thunder, for the humbling of <hi>Job,</hi> God commanded it to Thunder for his deeper humiliation: and if ſo, the cauſe why <hi>Elihu</hi> trembled is apparent enough; The terrible Thunder-claps

                  <p>Which is added to ſet forth the exceeding greatneſs of that fear which ſeized upon him. The Text ſpeaks as if his heart <hi>were indeed removed</hi> or taken out of his body.

                  <p>It hath made and may make the ſtouteſt heart to tremble.

The <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtorian reports of that great Emperour, who commanded all the world, and made the nations to tremble, that yet he himſelf trembled <hi>at this. Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> was ſo afraid of thunder, that when-ever he travelled abroad, he cauſed the skin of a Sea Calfe to be carried about with him, becauſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it was in their ſuperſtition believed to be an Amulet or preſervative againſt any hurt by thunder. And the ſame Author tells us of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of that ranke, a heathen <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour, that was ſo afraid of thunder, that he would hide his head when he heard it, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ran under a bed for ſhelter. I ſhall have further occaſion to ſpeak of the terribleneſs of thunder, at the 4th and 5th verſes; I touch it here, becauſe, according to our interpretation, this was it at which the heart of <hi>Elihu trembled.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Taking the words more generally, as this trembling might ariſe from the conſideration of any other of the wonderful wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <p>Note;
<q>The great appearances of God in his power may and ſhould affect us even with feare and trembling.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The heart of man may wel move out of his place when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders how dreadful God is in his place, and what wonders he both doth and can do. <hi>David</hi> caſting his eye up to the heavens and the hoſt of them (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.) concludes with admiration (v. 8.) <hi>O Lord our God, how excellent is thy Name in all the world!</hi> They who have but little knowledge of the works of God, cannot be much affected with them; they who know them deeply cannot, but be deeply affected with them. Fooles and ignorant perſons ſlight or lightly paſs by any thing that God doth or ſpeaks; but they who are wiſe hearted will lay both his Word and Wo ks to heart, their hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ts will tremble and be moved out of their place. Holy King <hi>David</hi> adviſeth the Kings and Judges of the earth to <hi>ſerve the Lord with fear and to rejoyce with trembling</hi> (Pſ. 2 11.) And the holy Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth all Chriſtans <hi>to work out their ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with fear and trembling</hi> (Philip. 2.12.) Now if we are to tremble in our dayly ſervice, how much more under dreadful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences!</p>
                  <p>For the cloſe of this poynt, remember there is a four-fold trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:48335:224"/> or moving of the heart at the appearances of God, or at the diſcoveries of his Power and Glory in his Word and in his Works.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That which is natural. (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 7.2.) <hi>When it was told the houſe of David, ſaying, Syria is confederate with Ephraim;</hi> his heart (that is, the heart of <hi>Ahaz) was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the Wood are moved with the wind.</hi> And when <hi>Felix</hi> heard <hi>Paul reaſoning of righteouſneſs, temperance, and the judgment to come, he trembled:</hi> The Judge trembled at the voyce of the priſoner. 'Tis natural for man to fear and tremble at the report of any truth which renders him guilty, or of any trouble which over-maſters his ability to withſtand or avoyd it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is a Legal trembling, proceeding from a ſpirit of bondage, or the dreadful apprehenſions of the wrath of God againſt ſin (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15.) This in many is precedaneous to their true converſion, and, as a needle, makes way for the ſpirit of grace and adoption, by which thread they are united &amp; faſtned unto God through faith, &amp; walk in a child-like fear before him all their days.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, There is a penal or judiciary fear and trembling. God in judgement ſometimes fills the heart of ſinful man with fear, as the puniſhment of his ſin. They who have no fear of God in their hearts to keep or over-aw them graciouſly from ſinning and living in a courſe of ſin, are delivered up to a ſpirit of fear, which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually purſueth them with dreadful apprehenſions of the wrath of God, and of ſome imminent and impendent evils, ready to fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them for their ſins; <hi>A dreadful ſound is in their ears</hi> (as <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas</hi> told <hi>Job, Chap.</hi> 15.21.) yea, as he ſpeaks there (<hi>verſ.</hi> 24.) <hi>trouble and anguiſh make him afraid; they prevail againſt him, as a King ready to battel.</hi> The Lord threaten'd it as one of the ſore Judgments that he would bring upon his People the Jewes, for their diſobedience (<hi>Deut.</hi> 28.65.) <hi>I will give thee a trembling heart;</hi> yea, he threaten'd (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 52.17.) to give them the <hi>dregs of the Cup of trembling. Ezekiel (Chap.</hi> 12.18.) was commanded <hi>to tremble,</hi> as a ſign to the People of that penal fear and trembling which God would ſend upon them. Such was that trembling ſpoken of (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 26.16.) <hi>Then all the Princes of the Sea ſhall come down from their Thrones, and lay away their Robes, and put off their broidered garments, and ſhall cloath themſelves with tremblings.</hi> Doubtleſs they had little mind to ſuch change of ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they had rather have been cloathed with raggs; but the
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:48335:224"/> Lord would make them do it. And as thoſe confederate Princes or friends of <hi>Tirus</hi> ſhould cloath themſelves with trembling, ſo 'tis propheſied (<hi>Zech.</hi> 15.2.) that <hi>Jeruſalem ſhould be, not only a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſome ſtone, but a cup of trembling to all her enemies.</hi> As if the Lord had ſaid, This ſhall be their puniſhment who would make my <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> tremble, I will make them tremble at the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or at the ſight of thoſe great things which I will do againſt them, and for <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, There is a ſpiritual, a gracious trembling and moving of the heart; that's it which this point calls us to, and to which, in thoſe places lately mentioned, both <hi>David (Pſal.</hi> 2.11.) and the Apoſtle (<hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12.) call us to. It was well with <hi>Ephraim,</hi> when it was thus with him (<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.1.) <hi>When Ephraim ſpake trembling he was exalted,</hi> that is, when he was in a trembling, humble, ſelf-denying frame, he proſpered, and all things ſucceeded well with him. The Lord is never better pleaſed with us, than when he ſees us in theſe tremblings (<hi>Iſay.</hi> 66.2.) <hi>To him will I look that is poor, and of a contrite ſpirit, and trembleth at my word;</hi> Theſe trembling ones are the men that God hath an eye upon and reſpect unto. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Habakkuk</hi> ſpake of himſelf (<hi>Chap.</hi> 3.16.) much like <hi>Elihu</hi> in the text, <hi>When I heard, my belly trembled, my lips quivered at the voice,</hi> &amp;c. The prophet fore-ſaw a day of trouble, and trembled at it, and this gave him aſſurance that he ſhould not tremble when he ſaw it, for (ſaid he in the next words) <hi>I trembled in my ſelf that I might reſt in the day of trouble.</hi> The more we tremble in our ſelves, the more reſt we have in God. None have ſo little fear when trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble comes, as they who fear before it comes. <hi>Noah, by faith mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by fear, prepared an arke to the ſaving of his houſe (Heb.</hi> 11.7.) Thus to fear a flood is the beſt way to eſcape it. 'Tis not courage, but ſtupidity, not to fear and tremble, when we hear of the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God. They who tremble graciouſly ſhall never tremble deſpairingly. <hi>At this my heart trembleth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Elihu</hi> having thus ſhewed how himſelf was affected, with a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious fear and trembling, labours to affect others alſo with the ſame fear, in the next verſe.</p>

                  <p>According to the former interpretation <hi>the noiſe of his voice</hi> is the noiſe of thunder; that, if any thing, makes a noiſe, a dreadful noiſe, as was toucht before, a noiſe like the roa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Now, if Thunder be the Voice of God, or the noiſe of his Voice, then take theſe brief Inferences from it.</p>
                  <pb n="443" facs="tcp:48335:226"/>
                  <p>Firſt, Let us ſee what a powerful and mighty God we have! When it thunders, every believing ſoul may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thirdly, If God ſpeak with ſuch a Voice as this in the Air, take heed of ſlighting his Voice whenſoever he ſpeaks in the Church, as Athieſts and Epicures do. He who ſpeaks ſo loud in Thunder can thunder upon us at any time. The Word preached, if not obeyed, will at laſt come upon all thoſe who obey it not, with as great a terror as Thunder.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Let us not be amazed and frighted at Thunder as Heathens or Unbelievers.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Let us not think lightly of it, as if it either came by chance, or meerly from natural cauſes.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Let us fear the God of Thunder, not fear Thunder as a God.</p>
                  <p>Some have ſuperſtitiouſly thought Thunder was a God, and adored it: ſo 'tis reported of the <hi>Lithuanians</hi> anciently,<note place="margin">Lithuani ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon deum eſſe pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rible threats but loud thunder-claps? yet few hear, or though they hear, yet they attend not. Not to hear the voice of God in his Word, is as if you did not attend to the voice of Thunder. Every word of God, though ſpoken with a ſtill voice, hath a greater force in it than Thunder from the Clouds. As the terrible works of God are ſignified by Thunder (<hi>Rev.</hi> 10.3, 4.) So the terrible words of God, his threatning words againſt impenitent ſinners, are reſembled to Thunder. And therefore ſuch as the Lord fitted among his own Apoſtles for that diſpenſation, are called in Scripture <hi>Sons of Thunder (Mark</hi> 3.17.) And they who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence the Word with a ſtrong voice and fiery zeal, are truly ſo called to this day, and may be ſaid both <hi>to Thunder in their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, and to Lighten in their Converſation.</hi> And indeed the Word of God truly and faithfully diſpenſed by any is like Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. For,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, As Thunder, ſo the Word ſpoken is the Voice of God, and a more excellent and diſtinct Voice than Thunder; that only ſhewing in general that God is, or that he is great and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; this ſhewing us diſtinctly, who and what God is, and what he requireth of us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Thunder throwes down and diſſipates high things; So doth the Word of God (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5.)</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Thunder is irreſiſtable by any power of man, it will make its way through all oppoſition; ſo is and doth the Word of God.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Thunder pierceth very ſubtilly, it reacheth the bones quite through the fleſh; the Word of God doth more, it <hi>divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth ſoul and ſpirit, and the joynts and marrow, and is a diſcerner of the thoughts and intents of the hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t</hi> (Heb. 4.12.)</p>
                  <pb n="445" facs="tcp:48335:227"/>
                  <p>Fifthly, Thunder breaketh the hardeſt things which reſiſt it, but not ſoft things; ſo the Word of God breaks the ſtout, but binds up the contrite ſpirit; it <hi>reſiſts the proud, but giveth grace to the humble</hi> (Jam. 4.6.)</p>
                  <p>Now if the Word of God be in all theſe reſpects like Thunder, Let us not only hear, but attend, or as the text ſaith, <hi>hear attentive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſound of his voice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If any ask, when do we both hear and attend with the inward and outward ear, the Thunder of God, or his voice both in his works and in his word? I anſwer,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, When we are ſtirred up to high and holy thoughts of God. We are never rightly affected with the Word of God, till our hearts are wrought up to, and deeply, at leaſt truly, affected with the God of the Word.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, When our hearts are raiſed up in thankfulneſs for any diſcoveries of God in his goodneſs and mercy to us, who can ſo eaſily deſtroy us by his power. He that trembles at this voice of God, and hath no ſenſe nor taſt of his goodneſs, nor is moved to praiſe and ſerve him, trembles only like a bruit beaſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, When we learn to depend and hang upon him for all, as he that can do all things graciouſly for us, as well as ſpeak ſo terribly to us; then <hi>we hear diligently the noiſe of his voice, axd the ſound that goeth out of his mouth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the cloſe of this matter I ſhall only adde; That though we ought to be affected with the voice of God in his Word, as with his voice in Thunder, yet let us not ſtay in that, which notes chiefly, if not only, that dread of God which the word leaves upon our ſpirits; but let us look after and labour for that effect of the Word, which like the beames and light of the Sun, may warme our hearts with joy, and leave ſtrongeſt impreſſions of the kindneſs and favour of God upon them. Mr. <hi>Forbes,</hi> opening that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (<hi>Rev.</hi> 14.2.) where St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>He heard a voice from heaven,</hi> and that of three ſorts.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>He heard a voice, as the voice of many Waters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, As the <hi>voice of a great Thunder.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He heard <hi>the voice of harpers harping w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. The word of God (ſaith he) hath three degrees of opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the hearts of men.</p>
                  <pb n="446" facs="tcp:48335:228"/>
                  <p>Firſt, It comes into mens eares, <hi>as the ſound of many waters,</hi> which is a kind of confuſed noiſe, and commonly bringeth neither terror nor joy, but a wondering acknowledgment of a ſtrange force, and more than humane power; as we read of thoſe (<hi>Mark.</hi> 1.) who having heard the word of Chriſt <hi>were aſtoniſhed at his doctrine</hi> (v. 22.) and were all amazed (v. 27.) <hi>inſomuch that they queſtioned among themſelves, what thing is this? what new doctrine is this?</hi> But knew not what to make of it.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond degree is, that the Word of God cometh to the ear of man like Thunder, which cauſeth not only wonder, but greater aſtoniſhment and amazement. Both theſe may be in a wicked pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane perſon, and are often found upon common profeſſors.</p>
                  <p>But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>here is a third degree or effect of the Words operation, which (ſtrictly taken) is proper and peculiar to the Elect, and that is, when the Word heard is <hi>as the voice of harpers harping with their harpes;</hi> that is, when the Word doth not only affect us with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, or ſtrike the heart with aſtoniſhment and terrour, like the <hi>ſound of many waters,</hi> and <hi>the voice of Thunder;</hi> but alſo filleth it with ſweet peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt, when the Word is like melodious muſick to the ſoul, raviſhing us with divine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, and raiſing us up to a heavenly life, while we are here ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journing on this earth.</p>

                  <p>Thirdly, I conclude our own tranſlation moſt ſuitable both to the Original text, and to the ſcope of this whole Chapter. Now, according to our rendring, the word comes from a root which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth <hi>to ſet a thing right</hi> or ſtrait, and from that a perſon who is right, a man of a right ſpirit, who ſquares and orders his actions by a right rule, and to a right end, is expreſſed (<hi>Chap.</hi> 1.1.) where <hi>Jobs</hi> character is given by this word, <hi>A man perfect and right,</hi> we ſay, upright, that is, a man that hath right aimes, and walkes by a right rule. <hi>Moſes (Deut.</hi> 32.15.) calls the people of God (collectively as one man) <hi>Jeſhuru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Such doubtleſs was that Thunder (<hi>John</hi> 12.28, 29.) when Chriſt prayed, <hi>Father, glorifie thy Name; then came there a voice from heaven, ſaying, I have both glorified it, and will glorifie it again.</hi> At the hearing of this voice, <hi>the people that ſtood by, ſaid that it thundred, others ſaid, that an Angel ſpake to him.</hi> This voice was an articulate ſound coming with the Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and the Hebrew word which we commonly tranſlate <hi>voyces,</hi> ſignifieth thunder. The Jewiſh Writers tell us that (<hi>Bath col) the daughter of voice</hi> (which they reckon the only way of divine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, left them after the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Captivity) was the will of God made known to them immediately from heaven by this ſort of Thunder. <hi>Thunders and voyces</hi> are often joyned in the Book of the <hi>Revelations (Chap.</hi> 4.5. <hi>chap.</hi> 8.5.) implying, the revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe prophetick wonders, was made by Voyces accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with Thunder.

                  </p>
                  <p>From this conſideration of Gods gradual ſpeaking to us in the Clouds, we may be led to conſider how gradually he ſpeaks to us in the Miniſtry of his Word; there he ſpeaks ſometimes whiſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, gently, he at firſt awakens the ear a little, but at laſt <hi>he roareth with his voice.</hi> If we will not hear, he hath louder and louder voices, which we ſhall hear whether we will or no.

<pb n="457" facs="tcp:48335:233"/> ſounded long, and waxed louder and louder.</hi> There are different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees in the loudneſs of the voice when God ſpeaks to his people. We ſhould take warning by the light that ſhineth, we ſhould hear the ſmalleſt voice, the firſt whiſperings of God, and not put him to his roaring voice.

                  <p>Now as there are many marvels wrought by natural thunder and lightning, ſo alſo by that which is ſpiritual. Nor will it be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſeful for us to conſider them upon occaſion of what is ſaid of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural thunder in this Scripture.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>God thundereth marveilouſly</hi> in the diſpenſation of his Word, or in his dealings with the ſouls of ſinners, to bring them home to himſelf, and to turn them from their ſins. We may (not exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the proper ſenſe) profitably expound the whole 29th <hi>Pſalm</hi> in this ſpiritual ſenſe; wherein the Lord under the Allegory of a terrible thunder-tempeſt, ſeems to give a prophetical deſcription of his mighty power in propagating the Goſpel to the ends of the earth; which goeth not out as an empty ſound beating the aire, but with wonderful efficacy, convincing the world of ſin, and of their need of Chriſt to ſave them from their ſins. And to ſhew that this is the ſcope of the Pſalm, <hi>David</hi> begins it with a ſtrong exhortation, (<hi>v.</hi> 1, 2.) <hi>Give unto the Lord, O ye mighty, give ye unto the Lord glory and ſtrength: Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his Name; worſhip the Lord in the beauty of holineſs.</hi> As if <hi>David</hi> had ſaid, <hi>O ye, the mighty Princes and Potentates of the world, who in most places and times have contemned God and his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worſhip; and being your ſelves either irreligious, or engaged in a falſe religion, have uſed your power against, and hindered the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the Goſpel, and the advancement of true religion; I adviſe and admoniſh you to lay down that ſpirit, to embrace th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="464" facs="tcp:48335:237"/> bleſs his people with peace.</hi> Thus the Lord <hi>thundereth marveilouſly</hi> and theſe are glorious marvels which he thundereth; he converts ſinners. The thunder of the Goſpel frights them out of ſin, and the grace of it gives them peace.</p>
                  <p>Thus, though I like not their way who are given to allegorize the Scriptures, yet, I doubt not but we may make a profitable uſe both of this and many other Scriptures by way of allegory. This being an undeniable truth, which is the ground of it, That the Lord puts forth, as it were, the power of Thunder and Lightning in the preaching of his Word, theſe two things are to be marked.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That Thunder and Lightning are a kind of Word of God to us, they tell us (though confuſedly, yet plainly enough, for the conviction and condemnation of gainſayers) there is a God; the greateſt Princes of the world have taken notice of Thunder and Tempeſt that there is a God over all, governing all; nor needs there any more teaching than that to condemne Athieſts and Mockers at Religion. We ſay proverbially of ſome men, who make a rude noiſe, they are ſo loud that we cannot <hi>hear God Thunder for them;</hi> yet know there's no noiſe can ſo drown the voice of Gods Thunder in the Clouds, but it will condemn all that hear it not, ſo as to acknowledg God in it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We ſhould mark, that as Thunder and Lightning are a kind of Voice or Word of God to us, ſo the Word of God, or the Voice of God, ſpeaking in his Word, is a kind of Thunder and Lightning to us, very mighty, very powerful, even clothed with an irreſiſtible power and might. And therefore if we take the Prophet <hi>David</hi> in 29th Pſalm before mentioned, ſpeaking, in the former part of it, of the effects of Natural Thunder only; yet toward the cloſe of the Pſalm, he applyeth it to the Word of God, while he ſaith (v. 9.) <hi>And in his Temple doth every one ſpeak of his glory;</hi> that is, the Word and Ordinances of God, miniſtred in his Church, or Temple, will put every one to acknowledge and ſpeak of the glorious Power of God, even much more than the mighty Thunder which ſoundeth in our eares, or the ſubtil Lightning which flaſheth in our eyes. There is a far more royal power in the Thunder of the Word, than in the word of Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; This terrifyeth only to Conviction, but that terrifieth to Salvation; for after God ſpeakes terror there in his Threatnings, he ſpeaks comfort in the Promiſes; and when he
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:48335:237"/> hath affrighted us with a ſenſe of our ſins, and of his wrath due to us for our ſins, as with an horrible tempeſt, he preſently refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us with the gentle gales of revealed g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<q>Great things doth he, which we cannot comprehend.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>We may take theſe words, not only as intending the great things of the Thunder, which indeed are ſuch as we cannot comprehend; but, as a tranſition from Thunder, to thoſe other great things that God doth, ſet forth in the latter part of the Chapter.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, <hi>We know not,</hi> that is, he doth ſuch great things, that let us conſider and ſtudy them as long as we will, let us break our brains to find out the greatneſs of them, yet we ſhall never find it out; <hi>He doth great things that we cannot comprehend.</hi> The text is clear, and the ſenſe profitable in either Interpretation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Again, from our reading, <hi>Great things doth he, which we cannot comprehend,</hi>

                  <p>Note;
<q>God doth great things that are beyond the greateſt of our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, ſuch things, as after all our ſtudy we are ſhort in, and ſhort of.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As it is our ſin that we take not paines enough to know the great
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:48335:239"/> things that God doth; ſo God doth things ſo great, that when we have done our beſt, or, after all our paines, we cannot know them fully: though we know their outſide, yet little of their inſide, though we know their effects, yet little of their cauſes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances. <hi>To know a thing, is to know it in the cauſes of it,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Scire eſt per cauſas ſcire.</note> to ſee the reaſon of it. A man knoweth not the things that he knows, till he ſeeth the reaſon of what he knows. How little doth man know of, or ſee into the reaſon of the great things that God doth? How little do we ſee of the marvels that are in the works of God? <hi>The love of God paſſeth knowledge (Epheſ.</hi> 3.19.) Though we labou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> to know it (and 'tis our ſin that we labour not more to know it) yet we cannot, it ſurpaſſeth all our knowledge. And as that love of God, which is the firſt mover of all the good and great things that he doth for his people, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>ſeth our knowledge, ſo the things that are the effects of that love to his people are ſo great, that they paſs our knowledge. Hence we may infer theſe two du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Let us be much in the admiration of the great things that God doth. Where knowledge ends, there admiration ſhould begin. It was a ſhame for a Philoſopher to admire, becauſe he was ſuppoſed to know the whole compaſs of nature; but 'tis no ſhame for a Chriſtian to admire, there being many things, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Let us take heed of cenſuring the works of God.</hi> Some are very bold in paſſing their Verdicts upon the great things that God doth; this, and that is not ſo well done, this and that might have been otherwiſe done. The great things which God doth pleaſe not many men if hey hit not their intereſt, how apt are they to find fault; But ſeeing God doth great things that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not comprehend, let us take heed of cenſuring any of the great things that God doth; no man ſhould judge or cenſure that which he doth not, cannot know, and fully underſtand: But uſually <hi>they who underſtand things leaſt, cenſure them moſt, and they are moſt apt to judge, who have the weakeſt judgements.</hi>

Firſt, for the whiteneſs of it. Snow is white as VVool; Snow is ſo exceeding white, that the whiteneſs of a Soul cleanſed by pardoning Grace, in the blood of Chriſt, is likened to it (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.18.) and the latter part of the ſame verſe intimates, that the whiteneſs of Snow bears reſemblance to that of VVool. The whiteneſs of Snow is cauſed by the abundance of
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:48335:242"/> Air and ſpirits that are in that pelluvid Body,<note place="margin">Cauſa albedinis eſt Spiritus ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſque copia in corpore diapha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no. <hi>Ariſt. lib. 2. de Mundo.</hi>
                     </note> as the Naturaliſts ſpeak: Any thing that is of a watery ſubſtance being frozen or much wrought upon by cold, appears more white. And hence it is that all perſons inhabiting cold Climates or Countries, are of a whiter complexion than they who inhabite hot.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Snow is like Wool for ſoftneſs, 'tis as plyable to the hand, as a Lock or Fleece of Wool.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Snow is like Wool (which may ſeem ſtrange) with reſpect to the warmneſs of it. Though Snow be cold in it ſelf, as I ſaid before, yet it is to the earth as Wool, or as a woolen cloth or blanket, that keeps the body warm. Snow is not warm formally, yet it is warm effectively and vertually, and there<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Theſe particulars laid together are a ſufficient witneſs, that even Snow and Rain a e to be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with, and numbred among the wonderful works of God.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note, Secondly;
<q>God can do what he will by a word ſpeaking.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as himſelf can do what he will by his word, ſo he can make the creature do what he will by his word.

                  <p>And if when the Lord ſaith to the Snow and to the Rain, come, and they come, abide upon the earth, and they abide there, how will this reprove and condemn thouſands of the children of

Surely Snow and Rain will riſe up in judgement againſt thoſe, to whom the Lord hath ſaid, <hi>do this,</hi> and they did it not, to whom the Lord hath ſaid, <hi>do not this,</hi> yet they did it. The word repreſents all ſorts of Creatures below man, as well as the Angels above man, readily obeying the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, to teach man how readily he ſhould obey his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and how greatly he ſhall be condemned if he do not, and that not only by the Angels in heaven, but by the Snow and Rain that fall upon the earth.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, From the deſtinction which is here made of the rain, the <hi>ſmall rain,</hi> and <hi>the great rain of his ſtrength,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note;
<q>In what degree or quantity ſoever the rain falls, it is by the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al appointment of God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>If it be a ſmall, gentle, ſoaking rain, it is becauſe God hath ſpoken to the ſmall rain to go; if it be a great, a violent, a ſmoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rain, a rain of his ſtrength, it is becauſe God hath ſaid to the great rain, go: We are not to ſtick in ſecond cauſes, but to have our hearts raiſed higher, both as to the rain it ſelf, and to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions of it. <hi>He maketh ſmall the drops of rain,</hi> as 'tis ſaid at the 27th Verſe of the former Chapter, and he can make great the drops of rain, of the drops of rain g eat; he can caſt the rain into what mold he pleaſeth, great or ſmall; it ſhall be a ſweetly-diſtilling rain, or it ſhall be, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeakes, a fiercely <hi>ſweep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rain</hi> (Prov. 28.3.) where he compares the poor man that oppreſſeth, to a ſweeping rain. God hath ſweeping rains, and as 'tis ſaid (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.13.) <hi>overflowing ſhowres</hi> in his hand; and he ſometimes ſends, not a watering ſhowre, not a refreſhing or comforting ſhowre in mercy, not a ſhowre to enrich and fatten the earth, but an overflowing ſhowre to drown the earth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the fruits of it in his anger; and this is true, whether you take the ſhowre properly, or metaphorically. If you take the ſhowre properly for that which falls from heaven, he ſends the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing, &amp; he ſends the overflowing ſhowre; or if you take it me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorically (a ſhowre may ſignifie any kind or degree of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) he can ſend one judgement which ſhall be as ſmall rain.
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:48335:244"/> and he can ſend another which ſhall be as great rain, as the rain of his ſtrength, an overflowing ſhowre: He can ſend forth (as that alluſion is uſed, <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.5.) <hi>his footmen,</hi> and he can ſend forth <hi>his horſemen,</hi> greater or leſſer Judgments, as himſelf pleaſeth; he proporti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Laſtly, From theſe words, <hi>He ſaith to the ſnow, abide on the earth, or be thou on the earth,</hi> ſtay there, and ſo to the rain,</p>
                  <p>Obſerve;
<q>Snow or Rain continue or ſtay upon the face of the earth till God calls them off.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>When he ſaith, be ye upon the earth, upon the earth they will be, until the ſame power that ſent them, fetch them back again. Theſe hoſts are like a well ordered and well diſciplined army, wherein Souldiers ſent out by the order of their General or ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Officers, muſt ſtay at their poſt where they are appointed, they muſt abide, till called off, upon pain of death: Be thou there, ſaith the Commander to his Souldier, be thou there till I fetch thee off; and when, after ſignal given, the battel begins, the Souldier never leaves charging or purſuing the enemy, till the trumpet ſound a retreat. So 'tis in this caſe, God ſaith to the Rain, be upon the earth till thou haſt wrought my purpoſe and done all my pleaſure, and there it is.</p>

<pb n="477" facs="tcp:48335:244"/> various apprehenſions about the meaning of this command given the Prophet, yet the moſt probable intendment of it is, that God would not have him loſe any more time in dealing with thoſe faithleſs and profane ſcoffers of his meſſage, but reſerve thoſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred myſteries, as ſecrets, to be communicated only to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, who would with due reverence and faith religiouſly receive them. <hi>Seal the Law among, or for my diſciples,</hi> that is, ſuch as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to learn, or have been taught and learned of me, and by learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are become ſpiritually skilful and learned, as the word is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.4.) Woe to ſinners when the Teſtimony is bound and the Law ſealed; which is the import (I conceive) of that place in the ſame Prophet (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.11.) And when in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation (Chap.</hi> 4.1.) a Book ſealed with ſeven ſeals was ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>John,</hi> he wept (<hi>verſ.</hi> 4.) becauſe <hi>no man was found wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to open, and to read the Book,</hi> &amp;c. implying, that the Book was full of divine ſecrets, hidden from the eyes or underſtandings of men, and ſo muſt have continued, <hi>if the Lion of the Tribe of Judah, the Root of David,</hi> that is, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>had not prevailed to open the Book, and to loſe the ſeven ſeals thereof.</hi> Sealed things are hidden things. <hi>Is not this</hi> (ſaid the Lord, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.34.) <hi>laid up in ſtore with me, and ſealed up among my treaſures?</hi> That is, is it not kept cloſe and hidden there? are not their curſed trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of ſin laid up among my righteous treaſures of wrath? The Church (<hi>Cant.</hi> 4.12.) is called, <hi>a Fountain ſealed,</hi> becauſe the waters by which ſhe is refreſhed and made fruitful are a hidden thing to the world, or becauſe the Church muſt keep her ſelf apart and diſtinct from the prophane and unbelieving world. That's one thing, we ſeal what we would hide or keep cloſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the word importeth ſometimes, to finiſh or compleat a thing. When a Writing is perfected then we ſeal it, when a Letter is made up we ſeal it; to that purpoſe the word is uſed (<hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24.) Where the Prophet ſpeaking of Chriſts coming in the fleſh, and what he ſhould then do, ſaith, <hi>He ſhall finiſh tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion,</hi> that is, he ſhall compleat, by the ſacrifice of himſelf, all the ſacrifices for tranſgreſſion. Chriſt had no hand in any tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, as to the doing of it, but in this ſence he finiſhed all tranſgreſſion; that is, he finiſhed the ſacrifices of atonement for tranſgreſſion, that ſo our tranſgreſſions might not be charged upon us. Further, that word, as there uſed, may very well bear the firſt
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:48335:245"/> ſence of ſealing; <hi>He ſhall ſeal tranſgreſſion,</hi> that is, he ſhall cover or hide our tranſgreſſions, for that is the effect of the Mediator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, To ſeal a thing is (in common ſence) to confirm it (<hi>Jer.</hi> 32.10, 11.) <hi>I</hi> (ſaid the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<q>That all men might know his work.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>God by extraordinary Snowes and Raines ſtops men from their work. But what, Is it that they ſhould be idle? No, but that <hi>they may know his work.</hi> Whoſe work?</p>
                  <p>Some underſtand it of mans own work; As if the meaning were this; God ſtops men a while from further or preſent work, that they may take a view of their paſt works; or he takes them off from their civil works and employments, that they may employ themſelves in conſidering their moral works; as the Prophet ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed the Jews (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.5.) <hi>Now therefore, thus ſaith the Lord of hoſts, conſider your wayes.</hi> Another Prophet reproved them for the neglect of this duty (<hi>Jer.</hi> 8.6.) <hi>No man ſaith, what have I done?</hi> The Lord often brings his people to hard ſufferings that they may know their own doings or works. This is a profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſenſe; yet I rather conceive that the work here intended is Gods work, and ſo I ſhall proſecute the words, <hi>That all men may know his work.</hi>

                  <p>Firſt, More ſt ictly; thus God by rain ſhuts up the hands of men from their wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>k, that they may know, thoſe extraordinary ſtormes of Snow and Rain, which drive them in from their labour, and ſhut up their hands from working, are his ſpecial work. Great Snowes &amp; Raines declare to all men the great power of God, who doth not only aſtoniſh men by terrible thunder and lightning, but can by Snow and Rain (his much weaker weapons) put them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide their purpoſe, and ſtop their work.</p>
                  <pb n="480" facs="tcp:48335:246"/>
                  <p>Secondly, Take his <hi>work</hi> more largly; God ſealeth up the hands of men, that they having a vacancy from their own work may conſider his; he doth as it were force them from what they were doing or intended to do, that ſo they may have leiſure to take notice of what he hath done, <hi>That all men may know his work.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note, Firſt;
<q>God can hinder or ſtop any man or all men in their work.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He, when, and as he pleaſeth, can ſeal up the hand of every man. If God hath a mind to work, none can lett him (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.13.) Who can ſeal the hand of God? I may ſay alſo, whoſe hand can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not God ſeal? How eaſily did the Lord ſeal up the hand of the the builders of <hi>Babel (Gen.</hi> 11.7.) They were hot upon a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty work; but God by confounding their tongues, ſealed their hands, and they (as 'tis ſaid, <hi>v.</hi> 8.) <hi>Left off to build the City.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, When the text ſaith, <hi>God ſealeth up the hand of every man, that all men may know his work,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerve;
<q>How diligent ſoever men are about their own works, yet they are ſlow enough, too too ſlow to take notice of the work<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> of God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the hand of God is lifted up ſome will not ſee it, they are not only backward to ſee it, but oppoſite to the ſeeing of it; and though others do not ſet themſelves againſt, yet they do not ſet themſelves to the knowledge of his works. 'Tis a great and common ſin, our not ſtudying to know the works of God; we ſhould ſtudy the works of God as much as we do the word of God; we ſhould ſtudy both his work of Creation, and his works of Providence, whether works of Mercy, or of Judgment; we ſhould endeavour to know all his works.</p>
                  <p>From the univerſality of the expreſſion, <hi>that all m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                  </p>
                  <p>Note;
<q>God would have all ſtudy this Book, the book of his works.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>They whoſe buſineſs and labours lie in fields, the Plow-men and the Vine-dreſſers, he would have them know his works, as
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:48335:246"/> thoſe ſpecial works of his, the Snow and the Rain, ſo his works in general. The meaneſt of men cannot excuſe their ignorance of the works of God, ſeing the Text and Point tell us, God drives them many times out of the field, home to their houſes, and will not let them do a ſtroak of work more abroad, on purpoſe that they might know his work.</p>
                  <p>Hence note, Thirdly;
<q>The aim and intendment of God in keeping us at any time from our work, is that we may know more of his works.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is a great part of our wiſdom to anſwer the deſignes of God in all his providences to us. We ſeldom think what God intends by a wet day, by a rainy day, by a tempeſtuous day, we little think the aim of God in calling us from our works, is to call us to the conſideration of his work. Some men would never find a time to beſtow their thoughts upon the works of God, if God did not take them off from their own work; they would never be at lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, if he did not give them a leiſure, a vacation time, and as here in this text, ſeal up their hand. God hath various wayes to take men off from the hotteſt purſuits of their own works; he takes many off from them by ſickneſs, he binds them as priſoners to their beds; others are taken off from their own buſineſs by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per impriſonment, and reſtraint of liberty; and why? what is the reaſon of this? is it not that they may know his work, that they may well conſider the dealings of God with them? A ſick bed is a School, and ſo is a Priſon, where we ſhould ſtudy both the Word and Works of God. Let us remember, when-ever God takes us off from our Callings by ſickneſs, or reſtraineth our liberty by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, his gracious purpoſe is, that we may know his work. Poſſibly when we had liberty to go about our own work, we could find little, or would not find much leiſure to meditate upon the works of God. Well, ſaith God, I ſee I muſt take you off from your works, elſe you will never be Students in mine. That's the effect of Snow and Rain, with reference to man, <hi>He ſealeth up the hand of every ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>But here we have another effect, with reſpect to beaſts.</p>

                  <p>They not only <hi>go into dens,</hi> but there <hi>they remain,</hi> they keep home, the ſtorm keps them in.

                  <p>Great ſnowes and rains of ſtrength are dangerous or g ievous to beaſts, therefore they avoid them; they will not ſtand in the open air while a ſtorm laſts, if they can help it.

                  <p>Firſt, <hi>For our inſtruction. We are ſent to ſchool by God himſelf more than once to the beaſts and creeping things of the earth. Solomon</hi> ſends us to the Ant, a creeping thing, he bids us <hi>conſider her wayes, and be wiſe. Elihu,</hi> in this text, ſends us to the wild beaſts of the earth, to Lions and Bares, to Tigers and Wolves, and bids us conſider their wayes and be wiſe. Here is matter of inſtruction for us; What is that? <hi>Get out of harmes way,</hi> make haſte out of danger; when the cold Snow comes, and the great Rain of the ſtrength of God, take heed you be not found abroad without a a ſhelter. Surely God who hath provided dens for the beaſts, and places for thoſe wilde creatures to hide themſelves in, hath not left us without a niding-place, when the great rains of trouble fall, or threaten to fall. God invited his people of old, where to look for and whither to go for ſhelter in ſuch a rainy day (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.20.) <hi>Come my people, enter thou into thy Chambers, and ſhut thy door a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:48335:248"/> thee; hide thy ſelf as it were for a little moment, until the indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation be over-paſt.</hi> For, <hi>Behold, the Lord cometh out of his place to puniſh the Inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity.</hi> As if he had ſaid, <hi>Hide your ſelves till the ſtorm be over,</hi> till the great rain of my ſtreng h be gone. God, who hath put an inſtinct into the creatures to go to their dens, to their places in a ſtormy ſeaſon, doth ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally call to men, and among men, ſpecially to his own people, when 'tis a time of indignation, to go into their Chambers and hide themſelves till it be overblown. Do not ſtand out in the rain, do not ſtand in the ſtorm, get into your chambers; what are theſe Chambers? ſurely not the chambers of our houſes, they are poor refuges, the rain of his ſtrength will break or ſoak into thoſe chambers, how well ſoever roofed or ceiled. The chambers in which the people of God are called to hide themſelves, are God himſelf; the Power of God, the Faithfulneſs of God, the Truth of God, the Goodneſs of God, in theſe Chambers he calls his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to hide themſelves. <hi>Solomon</hi> aſſureth us (<hi>Prov.</hi> 81.10.) <hi>The Name of the Lord is a ſtrong tower, the righteous runneth into it and is ſafe.</hi> As God hath taught the beaſts to run into their dens, ſo he inſtructs us in his Word to run into his Name, as to a ſtrong tower, where we may be ſafe. <hi>David</hi> ſaid (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 57.1.) <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder the ſhadow of thy Wings ſhall be my refuge until this calamity be over-paſt;</hi> That is, I will put my ſelf under thy protection, while the ſtormy ſhowers laſt. The Hen g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And hence, let ſinners in general take warning; ſuppoſe you ſhould live all your dayes in this world without a ſtorm, I mean, without any outward trouble, yet remember, there will be a ſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my day, the day of the great rain of the ſtreng<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Therefore ſee that you have a refuge againſt that day, when many ſhall (as it is ſaid, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.) <hi>Call to the rocks, hide us, and to the mountains, fall upon us, cover us from the preſence of him that ſits on the Throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb.</hi> Although we ſhould have proſperity or fair weather as long as we live in this world, yet there is a day of wrath coming; be not then to ſeek of a hiding place, which is only to be had in and by Jeſus Chriſt; He is the man chiefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the Prophet (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 32.2.) <hi>That ſhall be a hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempeſt.</hi> If you are without him in that day, you ſtand naked to the wrath of God, and that will quickly ſoak into you, or ſink you for ever.</p>

                  <p>'Tis ſaid, the very Vermine, Mice and Rats, will (by a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral preſage) come out of a houſe that is ready to fall. They are more ſenſeleſs than Mice or Rats, who haſten not to a place of ſafety, when they perceive the foundation of that ſinful State wherein they ſtand, ſinking, and the walls cracking on every hand. How faithleſs then are they, how preſumptuous and ſenſeleſs who haſten not out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> when they hear the Scriptures of truth ſaying not only that <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhall fall, or is falling, but, as of a thing already done and paſt, <hi>Babylon is fallen, is fallen!</hi> Is it not dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to ſtay in a falling houſe, in a houſe which ſhall ſo certainly fall, that 'tis ſaid, and ſaid again, <hi>'tis fallen, 'tis fallen.</hi> O take heed of a hard heart when you hear of a falling houſe, or of a ſtorm ready
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:48335:249"/> to fall upon your heads. When God threatned <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to bring a ſtorm of hail upon the land of <hi>Egypt</hi> (that was indeed a rain of his ſtrength) a mighty rain of hail, the text ſaith (<hi>Exod.</hi> 9.20.) <hi>He that feared the word of the Lord amongst the ſervants of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh, made his ſervants and his cattel flee into the houſes;</hi> but they whoſe hearts were hardned, let them ſtay abroad, and ſo they pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed. Sinners, you hear of a worſe ſtorm of hail threatned than that which fell upon <hi>Egypt,</hi> even the great rain of the ſtrength of the Lords wrath, revealed from heaven againſt you; ſhall the beaſts in ſuch a day of diſtreſs go into dens, and remain in their places, and do you think to abide the day of the Lords terrible coming? Do you think to ſtand it out when he appeareth? The Prophet foreſhewing the day of Chriſts firſt coming in frail fleſh, ſaid (<hi>Mal.</hi> 3.2.) <hi>Who may abide the day of his coming? and who ſhall ſtand when he appeareth? for he is like a refiners fire, and like fullers ſope.</hi> Now if the day of Chriſts firſt coming was ſuch as ſinners could not abide, when he came only with <hi>refining fire</hi> to fetch out the droſs of their ſins, and purge away their corruptions, ſhall ſinners (impenitent and unbelieving ſinners I mean) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume that they ſhall be able to abide or endure that day of his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond coming, when he ſhall come with conſuming fire to puniſh and take vengeance on them for their ſins! Away with theſe vain confidences, which (as the Prophet told the <hi>Jewes, Jer.</hi> 2.37.) <hi>the Lord will certainly reject, and in which you can never proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> and go into thoſe <hi>holes of the rock,</hi> the wounds of a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified Saviour, in which, and in which only, you may be ſafe and ſaved for ever, from the Snow and great Rain of Gods ſtrength, the power of his anger, which none know at preſent (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.11.) but all muſt feel, who are not ſheltred from it by <hi>Jeſus Christ, who delivereth us from the wrath to come</hi> (1 Theſ. 1.10.)</p>

                     </gap>oſe places where the heat is moſt troubleſome, there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cool B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iezes. We read (<hi>Gen.</hi> 3.8.) <hi>of the cool of the day,</hi>
                     <pb n="491" facs="tcp:48335:251"/> or (as the Margin hath it) <hi>the wind of the day,</hi> implying that the extream heat of the day is uſually aſſwaged and cooled by the wind. The Prophet (<hi>Jer.</hi> 14.6.) deſcribing a time of drought, ſaith, <hi>The wild Aſſes did ſtand in the high places, they ſnuffed up the wind like Dragons.</hi> To ſnuffe the wind in time of drought, is a great refreſhing; wind refreſheth the body as well as food, and 'tis ſome refreſhing in famine, or want of food.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The wind is a <hi>Rain-bringer.</hi> We ſay when the wind riſeth there will be rain. Thus (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.45.) before the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty rain which <hi>Elijah</hi> foretold, we read of a wind; <hi>The Heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain.</hi> When <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha</hi> told thoſe three Kings diſtreſſed for want of water, <hi>Ye ſhall not ſee wind, neither ſhall ye ſee rain, yet that valley ſhall be filled with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> (2 Kings 3.17.) he thereby implyed, that wind is the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary fore-runner of rain. We, indeed, tranſlate (<hi>Prov.</hi> 25.23.) <hi>The North wind driveth away the rain;</hi> yet we put in the Margine, <hi>The North wind bringeth forth the rain.</hi> It is true of both; the wind ſcattereth and driveth away the rain, the wind alſo bringeth rain.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The wind cauſeth vegetables to flouriſh. A ſweet gale of wind is not only good for man and beaſt, but for the graſs, and for the herbs, for plants and trees, the blowing of the winds maketh them flouriſh; in alluſion unto which the Church ſpeaks (<hi>Cant.</hi> 4.16.) <hi>Awake, O North wind, and come thou South, blow upon my garden, that the ſpices thereof may flow out;</hi> that is, that my Graces, my faith in thee, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> love to thee, &amp;c. may put forth and appear. The ſpiritual wind, the breathings of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, draw forth ſpiritual fruit from the heart, and in the life of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, as the natural draws forth the natural fruits of the Earth.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, The winds are beneficial and helpful for the drying up of the waters, they make the earth clean as well as the air. It is ſaid (<hi>Gen.</hi> 8.1.) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>fter the whole world was drowned, <hi>God made a wind to paſs over the earth, and the waters aſſwaged.</hi> The wind is a dryer as well as the Sun.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, There is a great uſe of the winds, as to artificials. What mighty things are done by the wind? By it, Mills are tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to grin'd Corn a Land, and Ships are moved to carry bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="492" facs="tcp:48335:252"/> and precious things from one end of the earth to the other. Theſe and many more are the common benefits of the winds, for which the Lord brings them out of his treaſures.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The winds have their evil effects, God ſends them ſomtimes for a pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

                  <p>Secondly, As wind b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thi dly, The Lord ſends the wind to break and overthrow all that ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

God ſent a whirlwind out of his treaſure, which cauſed the Mariners in <hi>Jonah</hi> to caſt their Merchandize into the Sea, and <hi>Jonah</hi> himſelf too. What croſs and tempeſtuous winds did the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> meet with in his voyage to <hi>Rome</hi> (Acts 27.)</p>
                  <p>Further, That the Lord bringeth the winds out of his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, is matter of great comfort to all that have an intereſt in the Lord; He can command the winds for them, and againſt their enemies; the wind cometh out of his Chamber, and it ſhall do as he commandeth.

When there is not a breath of wind ſtirring, the Thiſtle-down will ſtir, roll, and move from place to place; what then, think you, will become of Thiſtle-down before a mighty wind, a whirlwind? The wicked ſhall be as Thiſtle-down before the whirlwind; but the people of God need not fear, for (as 'tis ſaid of the Sea, ſo of the wind) <hi>his way is in it,</hi> he rules the proper, and he rules the metaphorical whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winds, which toſs and tumble the ſtate and affaires of this world. To cloſe this matter,</p>
                  <p>We may take notice of ſeveral wonderfull things in and about the wind; and becauſe <hi>Elihu</hi> ranks this among the great works of God, who <hi>doth marveilous things which we comprehend not,</hi>

                  <p>Firſt, This is conſiderable, Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t there is ſcarce any Country but b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eeds ſome wind or other, which blows moſt there, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſeth a peculiar force upon it; theſe are called <hi>Provincial Winds.</hi> The North-weſt wind (ſaith <hi>Plinie</hi>) is proper to the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians,</hi> other parts of <hi>Greece</hi> having little acquaintance with it. The North-eaſt wind afflicts <hi>Calabria.</hi> And that ſeveral other winds, are congenial to other Countries, whereof ſome are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigne and favourable, others vexatious and uncomfortable to them, may be ſeen in the Authors quoted in the Margin.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, 'Tis a wonder that the ſame wind in one Country cauſeth fair weather, in another rain and ſtorms.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That the ſame wind is in one place very healthy, and in another cauſeth ſickneſs by corrupting the air, and ſo the blood and ſpirits of men. A learned Author ſaith, when-<hi>ever the South wind bloweth in ſuch a Country or City, the people fall ſick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="494" facs="tcp:48335:253"/>
                  <p>Fourthly, That's alſo obſervable, that ſome winds are hot and dry, others cold and moyſt, according to the temperature of the places from whence they come, and thorough which they paſſe to us.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, 'Tis marveilous that in ſome parts of the world, the wind blows conſtantly one way; ſuch are called <hi>trade windes.</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert Sea-men know where to fetch a wind, when once they get to ſuch a poynt they never miſs it. The <hi>Eteſian</hi> winds are fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly known in Hiſtory, blowing out of the Eaſt or North-eaſt yearly at one time, for the ſpace of forty dayes together; theſe <hi>Cicero</hi> called <hi>Anniverſary winds.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Yet in moſt places nothing is more unconſtant than the wind; inconſtancy it ſelf is Embleamed by the winds. No man knoweth when or where to have them certain for an houre; Hence we ſay, <hi>Take the Wind while it ſerveth. Wind and tyde tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for no man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seventhly, That's alſo wonderfull, That winds blow at once from contrary poynts, North and South, &amp;c. at the ſame time. <hi>Daniel</hi> (Chap. 7.2.) ſaw in a viſion the <hi>four Winds ſtriving toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon the Sea;</hi> All the winds were let looſe together, contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as it were) for victory.

That's true; yet, what hinders but that for a time there may be ſuch a conflict or battel fought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, as may extreamly trouble both the air and waters, and ſhake vehemently ſuch things as ſtand in their way on earth?

                     </note>I ſhall not trouble the reader with that wide interpretation of the Latine tranſlator, rendring thus, <hi>The cloud deſires corn,</hi> or <hi>the cloud labours for corn,</hi> that is, to make the earth fruitful, and bring forth abundance of corn. Some of the Ancients have taught that there is a kind of natural marriage, between the earth and the clouds, or between the clouds and the corn, or any other fruits of the earth. Rain is the food of the earth, that is, of Fruits and Plants; to which the Prophet (<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.22.) makes an elegant alluſion. But I paſs this.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond interpretation I judge moſt congruous to the ſcope of the text, which ſaith clearly, <hi>Alſo by watering he wearieth the thick cloud.</hi>

                  <p>Here is a cloud and a thick cloud (<hi>Elihu</hi> doth not ſpeak of an ordinary, but of a thick cloud) yet upon the Lords command to give ſhowres the cloud is quite ſpent and wearied.

The thickeſt clouds, that is, they who have the greateſt treaſures of ſtrength, of wit, of learning and knowledge, are ſoon wearied, exhauſted and emptied, unleſs they live in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance

And if God will ſpeak to the meaneſt creature, even to that which ſeemeth moſt empty, it ſhall water others and not be wearied. The thick clouds, they who have much, may be ſpent, while he that hath but a little ſhall not be ſpent. The Prophet ſaid to the poor woman (1 <hi>King.</hi> 17.14.) <hi>The oyl in the cruſe, and the meal in the barrel ſhall not waſte.</hi> The woman might draw out of the oyl as long as ſhe would, and ſtill there would be a ſupply of oyl, nor would the barrel be weary in yeelding meal.

There was a poor widow, and the creditors were ready to ſeize her two ſons for bondmen, and, ſaith ſhe, I have nothing but a little pot of oyl, and what will that do towards payment? Well, ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Go borrow thee veſſels abroad of all thy neighbours, even empty veſſels, borrow not a few,</hi> and thou ſhalt draw out of the pot, and the pot of oyl ſhall not be wearied by giving oyl into the veſſels. God ſpeaking to the pot of oyl it yeelded a continued ſupply; the oyl never ceaſed till the woman had not a veſſel to receive it. If God ſaith to the leaſt pittance of temporals, which a man hath in this world, hold out, it ſhall not fail nor be weary; 'tis ſo likewiſe in ſpiri uals, the Lord can make a little grace hold out, the thinneſt cloud ſhall not be wearied by watering.</p>
                  <p>Again, <hi>By watering he wearieth the thick cloud,</hi> that is, God giveth out ſhowres to water the earth abundantly.</p>

That which gathered the Cloud, may alſo ſcatter it. The Sun draweth up the vapours, of which Clouds are formed or compacted, and ſoone after the Sun diſſolveth the Clouds, which it had gathered.

                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Elihu</hi> ſhews the purpoſe, or the deſign of the Lord in turning about the Clouds by his counſel; which deſign is laid down two wayes.</p>

It is ſaid of <hi>Samuel</hi> (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.16.) <hi>He went from year to year in circuit, to Bethel and Gilgal, and Mizpet, and judged Iſrael in all theſe places.</hi> Thus the winds ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Commiſſion they receive from God, ride every year in circuit, now they are in one quarter, and anon in another, and whereſoever they come they may be ſaid to do judgment in a way of favour to ſome, and in a way of diſpleaſure unto others. The wind hath his Circuits, and as the Circuit of the wind is, ſuch is the Circuit of the Clouds; the motion of the Clouds is from the wind, ſome ſay from the Starrs, but moſt generally, as to the natural cauſe, it is from the wind, which way the wind moves, that way the Clouds move. And though the motion of

And the Hebrew word <hi>(Tachbuloth)</hi> here u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, hath a very great nea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>neſs in ſound, to the Tackling of a Ship. This is a moſt elegant Metaphor, ſhewing how the Lord doth, as it were, ſteer the courſe of the Clouds, or guide the Clouds, as the Sea-man doth his Ship; his Counſels may be compared to the Tack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and the Ropes, or rather to the Helme, by which the Ship is guided; God is as the great Pilot ſitting at the Stern, and he turns theſe Clouds as his Ship, he turns them about as a Ship tacks this way and that way, to reach her Port and there unlade. The Rain, Snow, &amp; Haile, are the Lading which theſe ſwift Ships, the Clouds, carry from place to place, to ſerve the providences of God towards man. This divine conduct of the Clouds is very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable! the Lord knowing what parts of the Earth need thoſe Commodities, Rain, Snow, &amp;c. which thoſe aerial Veſſels are laden with, for the enriching of the world. We render it <hi>by his Counſel,</hi> that is, by thoſe means which he in his Wiſdome and Counſel uſeth to turn the Clouds about, they are turned: we tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate the word (<hi>Pro.</hi> 1.5.) <hi>Wiſe Counſels,</hi> and (<hi>Pro.</hi> 20.18.) <hi>Good advice,</hi> there <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>With good advice make warre.</hi>
                     <pb n="507" facs="tcp:48335:261"/> And indeed good advice is the beſt tackling for Ships in a warre at Sea, and the beſt ammunition for a warre at Land: Councel is a noble, a notable Engine: The greateſt things on Earth are turned about by it, and ſo are thoſe great things in the air, the Clouds, <hi>They are turned about by his Counſel,</hi>
                     <q>That they may do whatſoever he Commandeth them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here's the general deſign and purpoſe of God, in turning about the Clouds whitherſoever he pleaſe, it is that they may do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he Commandeth them; where we have the Clouds ſet forth,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In their obedience, <hi>They do the Commands of God.</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, In the univerſality of their obedience, <hi>They do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he Commandeth. Elihu</hi> compares the Clouds and Meteors to good ſervants, who are ready to do what God their Maſter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of them; and not only ſo, but they do his Commands e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where, or whereſoever he requires them, they do all his Commands, and that in all places, as the Text ſpeaks in the next words,

                  </p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve, Firſt;
<q>The motion of the Clouds is not of themſelves, nor meerly from any natural cauſe or power, but of God;</q>
                  </p>

                  <p>Again, The <hi>Clouds are thus turned about by the Counſel of God, that they may do whatſoever he commandeth them.</hi>

<q>Clouds are ſent about work; there's ſomwhat to be done by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Cloud.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>God will not have a Vapour ariſe, nor a Cloud ſtir for nothing, he commands them to be doing. And if God ſend Clouds abroad to work, much more doth he ſend man forth into the world to do work, &amp; appoints him what work to do. The firſt Man was no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er made, and ſet up in a ſtate of created perfection, but he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſet to work, he muſt be doing (<hi>Gen.</hi> 2.15.) <hi>And the Lord God took the man</hi> (or <hi>Adam) and put him into the Garden of Eden, to dreſs and to till it.</hi> From the Angels in Heaven to the worms that creep upon the earth, there's no creature but hath ſomwhat to do; yea, not only the living and rational creatures, but (as here in the Text) the very inanimate creatures, the ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs creatures, the Clouds, have ſomwhat to do, God ſends them forth upon his buſineſs. Every creature hath a ſervice, hath ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to do: And therefore, <hi>it will be ill with thoſe whom God finds idle, or doing nothing, or nothing to any good purpoſe.</hi> That ſervant had been doing, to whom Chriſt in the Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thirdly obſerve;
<q>The Clouds are faithful and ready Servants, they do whatſoever the Lord commands them.</q>

                  <p>Secondly, Clouds execute the command of God in a way of favour; as they execute his threatnings, ſo they fulfil his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes (<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.21, 22.) Both theſe commands to the Clouds are expreſly mentioned in the next verſe, I only touch them here.</p>
                  <p>Now foraſmuch as the Clouds are here deſcribed under the notion of the preſt and faithful Servants of God, doing whatſoever he commands, take theſe Inferences from it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, If Clouds do whatſoever God commands them, then ſurely Chriſtians ought to do whatſoever Chriſt commands them: Shall the Clouds of God out do the children of God in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? We find that admonition often urged in the Scripture of the New Teſtament, eſpecially in the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Mathew,</hi> and in the 1ſt 2d and 3d Chapters of the <hi>Revelation, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</hi> But behold a wonder, they that have no ears hear! The Clouds have no ears, and yet they hear, and more than hear, they do the commands of God. What ſhall we ſay, when Clouds hear and obey, and men do neither? Let us learn Duty from the Clouds. We are ſent to the School of Nature in holy Scripture, almoſt throughout. <hi>Elihu</hi> ſeems to ſay, <hi>Go to the Clouds, O ye that are either ſlothful or diſobedient, conſider their work and be wiſe; they are continually doing whatſoever the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, If the Clouds do whatſoever God commands them, then here's matter of comfort to all who do what God commands them; ſurely God will not command the Clouds to do them any
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:48335:263"/> hurt who are doing his commands. If you can ſay that you do the commands of God, you may reſt aſſured God will never give the Clouds a command to do you hurt. I do not ſay but an affliction may drop out of the Clouds upon a man that is doing the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God; or, the Clouds may have a command to drop af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction upon him that is doing the commands of God: but the Clouds drop no hurt upon any that do the commands of God. And therefore ſeeing the Clouds, even thoſe Clouds that carry Storms and Tempeſts, Thunder and Lightning, Snow, Hail, and Rain, the great Rain of his ſtrength, ſeing I ſay, theſe Clouds, that are the Treaſuries and Magazines of ſuch terrible things, are at the command of God, let not his faithful people fear; for when the Winds are Stormy, when the Clouds are black, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as we think, nothing but wrath and death in them, God will take care of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hem, and charge his Clouds to do them no harm. Clouds, whatſoever they are doing, are doing Gods commands, and doubtleſs he will not give them any commands for their hurt who keep and do his commands.</p>
                  <p>And as 'tis matter of comfort to the faithful Servants of God, that he commandeth the Clouds in the Air, ſo that he alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands thoſe Clouds which are raiſed in the hearts of men, or that ſit and appear in their faces and foreheads. We often ſee Clouds gather in the Brows of diſpleaſed mortals. As ſome are clouded with ſorrow, ſo others are clouded with anger and wrath. Thoſe black Clouds in the faces of men are as dreadful as the blackeſt Clouds in the Air; yet the Lord who commands the Clouds in the Air, commands the Clouds of anger and choler, of wrath and indignation, riſing out of the hearts, and appearing in the faces of men, and can blow them over, or blot them out, whenſoever he pleaſeth.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If the Lord by his commands orders the Clouds, and the Clouds are ready to execute his commands, then let us have high thoughts of the power of God, and of his commands. If men refuſe the commands of God, if the ſtout and hard hearts of men will not ſtoop to them, the Clouds of Heaven, yea, the clods of the earth will. Whatſoever God commands, he will have it done; not one title, not one <hi>Iota</hi> (as Chriſt ſpake of the Law) ſhall fall ſhort, or fail, or be unfulfilled. If ſuch and ſuch will not, others ſhall; if <hi>Jewes</hi> will not, <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhall; if the <hi>Jewes</hi> will
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:48335:263"/> not carry it like the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> God can and will raiſe up children unto <hi>Abraham</hi> of the Stones of the ſtreet; he will nor want inſtruments to anſwer his Counſels, nor to execute his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. God will ſhake Heaven and Earth, but he will have his Will done, and his decrees perfected, yea, he will diſſolve and ruine them rather than not have his Word fulfilled. That of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> (Pſal. 136.2.) <hi>Thou haſt magnified thy Word above all thy Name,</hi> is true of the word of command, as well as of the word of p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>omiſe. God will magnifie the word of his promiſe above all his Name, and he will alſo magnifie the word of his command above all his Name; that is, his Word is as a glaſs, wherein <hi>his Name,</hi> that is, his Holineſs, his Power, his Goodneſs, his Faithfulneſs, his Mercy, his Juſtice, and his Wrath, are to be ſeen, and ſhall be ſeen in the accompliſhments of it towards the children of men. Therefore fear and admire this mighty God, who will find means for the executing of his Word, for the doing of all that he hath ſpoken; <hi>The Clouds ſhall do whatſoever he commandeth them, upon the face of the World in the earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, If the Clouds are turned about by his Counſel, if he doth, as it were, hale the Ropes to turn the Clouds which way ſoever he pleaſeth, then, <hi>Whenſoever you ſee the Clouds gathered by the wind, remember God hath ſomwhat to do,</hi> there's ſomwhat to be done; theſe Clouds are the Servants of God, there's ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand or word of God or other to be fulfilled. We do not, as we ought, conſider the Counſel of God in the motion of the Clouds; yea, ſome when the Clouds gather, and the ſtorms of Wind or Rain, of Thunder and Lightning, break forth, are more ready to think of the Counſel of the Devil, than of God, they are apt to ſay, ſurely, <hi>There's Conjuring abroad:</hi> What's that, but the executing of the Devils Counſel? whereas we ſhould ſay, God doth it by his Counſel. Take heed of neglecting God when you ſee the Clouds; do not attribute their motion, or the moſt dreadful Storms that proceed from them, to any thing beſide the Counſel of God; for there is not the leaſt vapour can riſe out of the earth, for the making of a Cloud, but he cauſeth it to aſcend; there are not any materials gathered toward the conſtituting of a Cloud, but they are under Gods hand, he cauſeth the vapours to aſcend: and there is not the leaſt breath of wind can ſtir to move the Clouds (Clouds are moved with the wind) but as God hath
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:48335:264"/> appointed; neither bad Angel, nor good, can ſtir a Cloud, but as God willeth. And therefore look to the hand and counſel of God in all theſe things, take heed of ſtaying in any work of Nature, do not aſcribe theſe impreſſions and perturbations in the Air to the power of the Devil and wicked Arts; all is of the Lord, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is done. One of the Ancients ſaid concerning the Devils, when they deſired leave to enter the Swine, <hi>Why ſhould any of the ſheep of God be afraid of the Devil, when the Devils cannot have power over the Swine without leave from God?</hi> The Devil cannot move a breath of wind, but according to the will of God; though he be the Prince of the Air, yet there is a Prince above him, to whoſe commands all are ſubject, both in Heaven and in Earth.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, If it be ſo, that God commands the Clouds whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they come with their ſtorms or ſhowrs, then aſcribe the praiſe of all the good you receive from the clouds to God, and be humbled under the hand of God, whenſoever you receive outward dammage from the clouds, do not ſay it is a chance.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Learn hence the greatneſs and the ſoveraignty of God, ſay as they did admiringly (<hi>Math.</hi> 8.27.) <hi>Who is this, that both the Winds, and Seas, and Clouds obey him!</hi> None of the words of the Lord ſhall fall to the ground, as an Arrow or Dart that miſſeth th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Mark, or as water ſpilt, that cannot be gathered up again; which latter alluſion is ſpecially intimated (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.12, 19.) Here in the Text <hi>Elihu</hi> ſets forth the Power and Soveraignty of God, having all creatures at his beck and command, as hath been ſhewed already from other paſſages in this Book, and more will occurr hereafter. The Soveraignty of God over men can never be duly acknowledged, till we acknowledge his Soveraignty over Winds and Rain, Hail and Snow, which lye in the Bowels and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of the clouds, and from thence are diſpenced to the earth, at the will of God.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly and laſtly, If the clouds do whatſoever God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them, if they be ſuch faithful ſervants to God, then ſurely the clouds will one day riſe up, or come forth as witneſſes againſt all that reſiſt the commands of God: Not to obey them is bad enough, but to reſiſt them is far worſe. Chriſt would awaken the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> by telling them (<hi>Math</hi> 12.41.) <hi>The men of Nineveh ſhall riſe up in the Judgment againſt this Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, and ſhall condemn it, becauſe they repented at the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                     </gap>s then in the g eat Day, the very clouds and winds ſhall come in as witneſſes againſt all thoſe that have reſiſted the will of God in any of his commands. Have the Clouds (will he ſay) done whatſoever I command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them? and have you reſiſted? have you caſt my words behind your back, when the very Clouds have taken up, embrac'd, and fulfilled them? The Clouds will be a ſwift witneſs againſt all thoſe that rebel againſt the commands of God: The Snow and Rain, the Winds and Storms fulfilling his word, will bring in a caſting Evidence againſt all thoſe who have caſt his word behind their backs. All this we may read and ſee in the commanding pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God over the Clouds, and in their readineſs to obey.</p>

In this ſence the Cloud will find us out; we render well, <hi>He cauſeth it to come,</hi> that is, to come to that place or perſon, to that Nation or People, to which himſelf hath appointed it: <hi>He cauſeth it to come,</hi>

                  <p>Here are three ends or purpoſes of God, in communicating and commanding forth the Clouds, and we may take thoſe three ends two wayes.</p>
                  <p>The firſt of theſe and the laſt concern Man more ſpecially; the ſecond concerns all other creatures, both Plants and Beaſts of the earth; it concerns all, from the Cedar in <hi>Lebanon</hi> to the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſop

                  <p>Secondly, It ſignifies a Rod to govern with, or to rule with; and hence this word denotes the Scepter of a Prince. The two great <hi>Emblems of Magiſtracy</hi> are <hi>a Sword and a Scepter.</hi> The Scepter is in the faſhion of a Rod or VVand, which imports chaſtening and correction; and from hence it was that the chief of the Tribes of the Children of <hi>Iſrael (Numb.</hi> 17.2.) were commanded <hi>to take every one of them a Rod, according to the houſe of their Fathers, twelve Rods, and to write every mans Name upon his Rod, and lay them up in the Tabernacle of the Congregation, &amp;c.</hi> Now thoſe Rods given in by the Princes of the Tribes, were as ſo many Emblems of their Power and Authority, becauſe to the chief Magiſtrate the puniſhment of the faults and miſcarriages of all under his government did belong. And hence the ſame word ſignifies a Magiſtratical Rod or Scepter of Government, and a Tribe or whole Family under the Rod o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Yet I rather take it here for a <hi>Rod,</hi> which imports chaſtening or correcting, as we tranſlate, <hi>Whether it be for Correction.</hi> They that carryed the Rod or the Scepter, had alſo the power of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection in their hand, as was toucht before; and that may be one Reaſon why when God ſent <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>Pharaoh (Exod.</hi> 4.17.) upon that great Meſſage, the deliverance of the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> he commanded him <hi>to take his Rod in his hand;</hi> which Rod held out theſe two things. Firſt, that <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Secondly, to let <hi>Pharaoh</hi> know, that as God ſent him with a power, or cloathed him with a Commiſſion to treat with him, ſo with a power to ſcourge or plague him, even with ten Plagues. As if the Lord had ſaid, O <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> Seeſt thou this Rod in the hand of my ſervant <hi>Moſes;</hi> aſſure thy ſelf, thou ſhalt have ſtroke upon ſtroke, plague upon plague, if thou wilt not let my people go. But of that by the way. <hi>He cauſeth it to come for correction, or for a Rod.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>God can correct us by any of his Creatures.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He can make any thing a Rod; he can make neareſt Relations a Rod. A Son is ſomtimes a Rod to his Father; how often have miſcarrying and undutiful children been made a Rod of correction to their Parents? and they are uſually ſo, when Parents have not duly corrected their children for their undutifulneſs and miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.

                     </bibl> Hearken unto this, O Job.</q>
                  <p>We have more than once met with this awakening exhortation, which calleth for ſuch an harkening, as if a man were to be all ear in attending what is ſpoken. We may well render it, <hi>Ear this, O Job,</hi> take it, drink it in at thine ear; <hi>Hearken</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto this;</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Elihu</hi> doth not exhort him to attention in general, but draws it down to ſome ſpecial matter, <hi>Hearken unto this, O Job.</hi> Which words may have a double reference, either</p>
                  <p>Firſt, to what he had ſaid before (verſ. 13th) telling him how God ſends the Rain and cauſeth the Cloud to come, <hi>either for cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, or for his land, or for mercy; Hearken unto this, O Job,</hi> here's a leſſon for thee, remember it well, God ſends forth theſe ſervants of his, the Clouds to do his work, either for correction or for mercy, either in favour or in judgment; <hi>Hearken unto this, O Job:</hi> Or,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The words may refer to that which followeth, and ſo, as one calls them, they are an <hi>Exordium,</hi> a brief <hi>Exordium,</hi> or ſhort preface to what <hi>Elihu</hi> had further to ſay; as if he would a little relieve the ſpirits and quicken the attention of <hi>Job,</hi> by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting him, that he had ſome new matter to lay before him. As if he had ſaid, I have not yet uttered all my mind, I have ſomewhat more upon my heart, which I cannot hold in, both for thy conviction and inſtruction; <hi>Hearken unto this, O Job.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet it may be queſtioned, why <hi>Elihu</hi> ſhould thus ſtir up his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, either to conſider what he had ſpoken, or what he was now about to ſpeak? Was <hi>Job</hi> a heedleſs, an un-attentive hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er?
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:48335:270"/> We may conceive he was occaſioned to give him this ſpur, or excitation, for theſe three reaſons, or at leaſt ſome of them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, We may ſuppoſe, that <hi>Job</hi> having been entertained with a long diſcourſe, began to grow weary and ſlacken his attention, and therefore, as when we ſee one in a congregation remiſſe in hearing, or ſleeping out a weighty point, we jog him, or ſay, <hi>Hearken to this;</hi> ſo <hi>Elihu</hi> here.</p>
                  <p>Hence note, Firſt;
<q>A good hearer of the Word, may ſometimes want an awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing word.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He that is not (as <hi>Job</hi> was not) a <hi>first,</hi> nor <hi>ſecond,</hi> nor <hi>third-ground-hearer,</hi> but (as <hi>Job</hi> was) a <hi>fourth-ground-hearer,</hi> one that heareth with a good and honeſt heart, yet, even he may a little let down his watch, and give juſt occaſion to the ſpeaker for ſuch a ſhort diverſion as <hi>Elihu</hi> here uſed, <hi>Hearken (I pray) to this.</hi> There is a willingneſs of ſpirit in all <hi>fourth-ground,</hi> or <hi>right-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hearers,</hi> yet, there is alſo, even in them, a weakneſs of the fleſh; corruption may be ſtirring, temptation may be working, therefore 'tis no unneceſſary jealouſie in the Miniſters of the Goſpel, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to mingle or interweave ſuch paſſages as theſe, in ſpeaking to them, pray hearken, ſtir up and awaken your ſelves: There may be need of this (I ſay) where there is a general good bent of heart. Some pretending hearers are like the Idols of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, <hi>who have eyes and ſee not, eares and hear not;</hi> who, when they are hearing, ſet themſelves, at leaſt give way, to ſleep, and willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yeeld to the drowſineſs of their ſpirits; this ſheweth an evil heart: but a good man may be overtaken with drowſineſſe, and find much indiſpoſition to duty, while he is in duty, and then he will count it a favour, to hear ſuch a word as this caſt in, <hi>Pray hearken.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Elihu</hi> might afreſh provoke him to more ſerious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, becauſe the matter he had to deliver, was of more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, or did more nearly concern him, than what he had ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>Though the whole truth of God is to be attended to, yet there are ſome truths that call for ſpecial attention.</q>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="525" facs="tcp:48335:270"/>
                  <p>Here is an accent put upon the point in hand, <hi>Hearken to this.</hi> We ſhould not let any truth fall to the ground, truth is precious quite through, and we may ſay of truth as of gold, the very filings of it are precious. We ſave the leaſt duſt of Gold, every grain of it is of worth, and ſo is every grain, or the leaſt duſt of divine truth. <hi>One jot, one tittle of the Law</hi> (ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.18.) <hi>ſhall in no wiſe paſſe till all be fulfilled;</hi> Surely then, no jot, no tittle of it ſhould be lightly paſſed by, by us. Yet there are ſome divine truth like ſtuds of maſſe gold, or as jewels, which ought to be more carefully attended to, and laid up in the cabinet of the heart; Some truths have an emphaſis, a Selah ſet upon them, <hi>O hearken to theſe.</hi> Chriſt ſaith in the Goſpel, about the tything of mint, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſe and cummin, <hi>Theſe things ye ought to do,</hi> but be ſure ye do not leave the weightier matters of the Law, <hi>Judgment, Mercy and Faith undone</hi> (Matth. 23.23.) ſo ſay I, attend to the leaſt truths, but be ſure ye attend to fundamental truths, to thoſe truths upon which the whole weight of the ſoul ſtands; Such is, <hi>The great Myſtery of Godlineſs, God manifest in the fleſh;</hi> and the great Grace of Faith in that Myſtery: Theſe, with ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, are the fundamentals, the very vitalls of Religion; all falls and dies, unleſſe ye ſtand faſt and live in theſe: <hi>O hearken unto them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Elihu</hi> may be conceived to ſpeak thus to <hi>Job,</hi> becauſe he ſaw him about to interrupt him; poſſibly he might perceive a little paſſion ſtirring in him, therefore, not only to keep up his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, or to wind up his watch, but to repreſs and keep down ſome ſtormy troubled motions riſing in his ſpirit, <hi>Elihu</hi> made this ſhort interlocution or digreſſion, <hi>Hearken to this, O Job,</hi> ſuffer me to ſpeak out, do not take me off, I have not yet done.</p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>Patience is neceſſary in a good hearer;</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that not only for the doing what is heard, but for the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it. As we can never bring forth the fruit of that which we hear without patience, ſo neither can we without patience hear that which ſhould make us fruitful. The great grace to be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in hearing the Word, is Faith; yet we have need of Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in hearing the Word, and that in a double reſpect.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, We have need of Patience, as to continuance in hearing.
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:48335:271"/> Some would fain have done preſently, they cannot ſit it out, an hour is an year to them, the word is a wearineſs to them, they ſoon think they have enough.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is need of patience for ſubmiſſion to what is heard. How ſhort ſoever the Sermon is, yet when it pincheth the conſcience and pricketh the heart, it is not eaſily born. They who hear quietly ſome wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e ſome other; we hardly continue hearing with any patience, when to us, the word heard, is a hard ſaying, and bares hard upon either, our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences or our practiſes; when the ſinger is, as it were, laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and preſſeth the ſore, few can endure it. 'Tis eaſie to hear pleaſing things, but that which croſſeth our ſpirits or our wayes calls for patience. When <hi>Stephen,</hi> the <hi>Proto-martyr,</hi> preached to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and brought the word home to their conſciences, by that cloſe application (<hi>Acts</hi> 7.51.) <hi>Ye ſtiff-necked and uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in heart and ear, ye do alwayes reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt; as y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ur Fathers did, ſo do ye. At this word,</hi> or, <hi>when they heard theſe things, they were cut to the heart</hi> (ſaith the text) <hi>and they gnaſhed on them with their teeth;</hi> their patience was quite ſpent, they could hear no longer. And when St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake to that g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eat Aſſembly (<hi>Acts</hi> 22.1,—22, 23.) <hi>They gave him audience unto this word (I will ſend thee to the Gentiles) and then lift up their voices and ſaid, away with ſuch a fellow from the earth, for it is not fit that he ſhould live: Then they cryed out, and caſt off their clothes, and threw dust in the air.</hi> Thus they raved and were enraged, like angry, yea like mad dogs, when once their title was queſtioned, or (as we ſpeak) <hi>their coppy-hold toucht,</hi> by the mention of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> whom they greatly deſpiſed, and judged themſelves ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove. <hi>Hearken to this,</hi> to this pinching word, to the word that ſtrikes upon your luſts. <hi>The length of a Sermon ſpoiles the patience of ſome, but the ſtrength and ſearching power of it, ſpoiles the patience of more.</hi> A ſincere heart is willing to hear all, and is moſt pleaſed to hear that word, which gives deepeſt wounds to any corruption of heart or tranſgreſſion of life. Such words are wholſome, though bitter or ſharp, and the more they make us ſmart, the more me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal and healing they are.<note place="margin">

                  <p>There is a twofold <hi>ſtanding ſtill.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, Bodily. I do not conceive <hi>Elihu</hi> impoſing any ſuch ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture or compoſure upon <hi>Job,</hi> as to ſtand ſtill and not ſtir his body. The Hebrew is but one word, <hi>ſtand up.</hi> There is a liberty as to any comly geſture of the body in hearing; a man may lawfully ſit as-well as ſtand and hear, yet to ſtand up and hear, ſheweth a readineſſe of the mind, and a hungring deſire after the Word.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is a <hi>ſtanding ſtill</hi> of the mind. The body may ſtand as ſtill as a ſtake or ſtone, while the mind is in ſtrong moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yea, while there are moſt vehement commotions and pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations in the mind. This ſtill-ſtanding of the mind in hearing what is ſpoken may be taken in a double oppoſition.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To any impatience, unquietneſs or uncompoſedneſs of the mind when the word is ſpoken.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To any irreverence, ſlighting or diſregarding of the word ſpoken. To ſtand ſtill is to get the ſpirit quiet, to hear pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently; or to ſtand ſtill is to get the heart into a reverential frame, to hear affectionately. So then, to ſtand ſtill implieth both patience and reverence. We have like admonitions in the 30th chapter of this book (<hi>verſ.</hi> 20.) and chapter 32d (<hi>verſ.</hi> 16.) Yea, that admonition of <hi>Balaam</hi> was of like ſence with this (<hi>Num.</hi> 23.18.) <hi>Riſe up Balak, and hear.</hi> When <hi>Balaam</hi> was about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver his parable, and declare the mind of God concerning <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he called upon <hi>Balak</hi> to riſe and ſtand up, that is, to entertain the meſſage with reſpect. <hi>Hearken unto this, O Job, ſtand ſtill.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence note;
<q>We ought to be in a gracious quietneſs and compoſure of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit when we are called to hear and mind what God hath done or ſpoken.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Further, We ought to have a quiet, ſedate, compoſed ſpi it, not only when we hear doctrinal truths delivered from the word of God, but alſo when we hear of the providences and various wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It is but an half conſideration of the works of God, to conſider them abſtractly and nakedly, without their cloathings, that is, their circumſtances of time, place, perſons, when, where, how, for whom, and by whom they were done.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, We ſhould conſider the works of God, in their aims, ends, and tendencies; not only what they are, but what they lead to, what the purpoſe of God may be in them, with reſpect to our ſelves, with reſpect to the Church, with reſpect to the world, is very conſiderable. There is not a drop of rain that falls from Heaven, but it hath a purpoſe in it, and that not only to feed and nouriſh man by making the earth fruitfull, but to make our hearts and lives fruitfull.</p>

<q>The common, conſtant, and ordinary works of God, are full of wonders.</q>

                  <p>Though we rightly diſtinguiſh the works of God (as was touched before) into ordinary and extraordinary, common and wonderfull, yet did we fully underſtand them, there is a kind of wonder and miraculouſneſs in all the works of God, even in his moſt common, ordinary, or every dayes wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The very falling of the Rain hath a wonder in it, the blowing of the Wind hath a wonder in it, the motion of the Clouds hath a wonder in it, the growing of every ſpire of graſs out of the earth hath a wonder it it, the budding out of every leaf and bloſſom on the tree hath a wonder in it; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

<pb n="535" facs="tcp:48335:275"/> extraordinary and ordinary works of God, as to the reall wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of them, by two Scripture miracles. The ſtopping of the fire from burning the <hi>three Children,</hi> was a wonderfull work of God; ſo alſo is the making of ſuch a creature <hi>as burning Fire,</hi> yet who wonders at it? It was a wonderfull work of God to ſtop the mouthes of thoſe hungry Lyons from devouring <hi>Daniel;</hi> ſo alſo is the making of a devouring Lyon, yet who wonders at it? Now, ſeeing there are wonders even in the ordinary works of God,</p>
                  <p>We may take much comfort in our ſtraits, for 'tis no hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with God to work wonders; he works ſome for us every day, they are his daily works. If we need a miracle to ſave us in an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent danger, God can do it; when we ſee no means in the world to produce ſuch an effect, yet we are never the further from it. Gods ordinary works are full of wonder; He doth the hardeſt things with as much eaſe, as thoſe which we call and count the eaſieſt.</p>

The date of Gods order for diſpoſing the creature is from the beginning, yea from everlaſting. As the model of the Creation, what things ſhould be, was with him from everlaſting, ſo was the model of Providence, how all things ſhould be governed and diſpoſed of. The government of the world is as much of God as the Creation o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> giving of it a being. From the Starrs in Heaven, to the Wormes creeping upon the Earth, all creatures were and are guided in their courſe by him; he hath ſet them bounds which they cannot paſſe, and ſent out his word to them which they faile not to obſerve. Heathens, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, did not acknowledge God to be the Maker of the world, nor did they acknowledge him the diſpoſer of it, but aſcribed all the viciſſitudes here below to blind Fortune, or to uncertain
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:48335:276"/> Chance. <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> the fore-man, the wiſeſt of that rank, thought <hi>the World was eternal;</hi> he could not find how it had a beginning, and therefore concluded it had none: yet others of the wiſe Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then had a notion that there was a beginning, that there was a firſt-worker, but when or how he wrought they could not tell. And as the wiſeſt men, who had but the light of nature and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to teach them, were very dark about the beginning of all things, ſo alſo about their motion, they thought that all things either moved of themſelves, or that the ſupream Power having put Nature into a courſe, it acted alone, ſo that God never med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led about particulars. Whereas we are taught and aſſured, by this Scripture-Text, and many more, that God not only made all things, but diſpoſeth all things, even to the fall of a Sparrow upon the ground, or to the loſs of an hair of the head (<hi>Math.</hi> 10.20.)

                  <p>It may be matter of much comfort to us, that all things are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by God, that he diſpoſeth of Thunder and Lightning, of Rain and Wind, of Snow and Froſt; much more may it comfort us, that he diſpoſeth the affaires of men, of his Church and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. <hi>Known unto God are all his works, from the beginning of the world (Acts</hi> 15.18.) and therefore the Prophet brings in the Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And that we ſhould rather expound this place of the Rainbow, than either of the Lightning, or the Sun-ſhine, I ſhall briefly give theſe foure Reaſons, upon which I ground the Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Elihu</hi> had ſpoken of the Lightning and of the Sun-ſhine in the former parts of his diſcourſe, and therefore it is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that he ſhould return to either ſo ſoon.</p>

                     </gap>e; I ſay he ſhould have omitted a great part of that which belongs to the doctrine of the Meteors (all Meteorological Writers particularly handling this Doctrine of the Rainbow) if it be not found here.</p>
                  <p>We may take a fourth Reaſon of this Expoſition, becauſe this light is ſaid to ſhine <hi>in his Cloud:</hi> 'tis true, all Clouds are his, that is, Gods Clouds; but the Cloud in which the Rainbow doth at any time appear, is in a way of peculiarity and higher ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy called <hi>the Cloud of God, or Gods Cloud.</hi> All the Clouds are as Gods Bow, out of which he ſhoots his Arrows and Bolts; they are alſo called the <hi>Seat of God,</hi> on them he ſitteth as upon his Throne. Again, they are called <hi>his Chariot,</hi> upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them he rideth in his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty; but the Rainbow-cloud, is, as it were, the <hi>Royal Robe or Diadem of God,</hi> the ſpecial Clothing of God. The Lord ſaith at the 13th <hi>verſe</hi> of the 9th of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> where we have the firſt mention of the Rainbow, <hi>I do ſet my Bow in the Cloud;</hi> the Bow is Gods, and
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:48335:280"/> the Cloud is Gods, he is entitled to them both in a very eminent and ſpecial manner. God calleth it <hi>his Cloud,</hi> and <hi>his Bow;</hi> Not only, Firſt, becauſe he made the Cloud, &amp; the Sun-beams by which the Bow is made. But, Secondly, and chiefly, becauſe he hath put it to a ſpecial uſe, and given it a myſtical ſignification.</p>
                  <p>And therefore here we may take notice, that whereas the Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow is naturally a ſign of Rain, for it is alwayes accompanied with Clouds, or at leaſt with a Cloud ready to diſſolve and melt into Rain, and is therefore called by the Poet (<hi>Nuncia Junonis, Virg. Aeneid.</hi> 4.) the <hi>Harbingreſſe of Juno:</hi> yet on the contrary God appoynts it as a ſign of faire weather. And indeed God often works by contrary means, leſt we ſhould ſtick in means, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the effect, more than is due, to them. So then the Rainbow hath two different ſignifications, the firſt natural, of Rain, nor doth God promiſe to hinder or alter this courſe of nature. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, preternatural or inſtituted, of faire weather; which Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, and the world, is altogether ignorant of; only the Chu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ch and people of God underſtand it by faith upon the teſtimony or revealed will of God, that as often as the Bow appeareth in the Cloud, they have a renewed aſſurance that God will remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Earth, and moderate the Rain: nor doth this depend upon the nature of, or various colours appearing in the Rainbow, but purely upon the will and inſtitution of God. And the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I ſhall not inſiſt upon any large diſcourſe of the Rainbow, only take two or three things. This Meteor hath three Att<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ld again. Thus the Rainbow hath a ſpeech, a language of mercy in it towards the preſent world. It ſpeaks alſo the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God upon the old world, minding us of that Deluge of water that drowned them for their ſin; they had ſo defiled the Earth by their evil manners and prophaneſs, by their will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, Superſtition and Idolatry, that God in wrath ſent a Flood of water, not to waſh, or refreſh, but to deſtroy them: The Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow minds us of that dreadfull Judgment of God upon a corrupt World. And although the Rainbow gives us aſſurance that the World ſhall not be drowned again, how ſinfull ſoever it is, yet ſome, from the various colours of the Rainbow, whereof one is red and fiery, tell us, it proclaims that the World ſhall at laſt be conſumed by Fire. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> is plain that it ſhall be ſo, (2 <hi>Ep:</hi> 3.10.) <hi>The Elements ſhall melt with fervent heat;</hi> nor is it meerly a phancy, to ſay, that the fiery colours in the Rainbow are ſet there by God, to mind us of it.</p>
                  <p>Some have queſtioned whether the Rainbow were before the Flood or no? The reaſon or ground of the queſtion is given from that ſaying of God (<hi>Gen.</hi> 9.13.) <hi>I will ſet my Bow in the Cloud:</hi> it ſeems then there was no Rainbow before the Flood.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, The Rainbow may be conſidered two wayes; Firſt, as to its natural being; Secondly, as to its myſtical uſe. If we conſider the Rainbow as to its natural being, it was before the Flood, for the cauſes of it were before the Flood, which are wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery Clouds and the ſhining of the Sun: <hi>Now when ſufficient cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes appear in act, the effect doth certainly follow.</hi> But as to its my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical uſe, it was not before the Flood. Water had its natural ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary being and uſe, before Baptiſme was inſtituted, but it had not a ſpiritual uſe till then: we may ſay the ſame of the Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow. Some I know of the Moderns, <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Melancthon</hi> aſſert,
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:48335:281"/> it was not in being till then; but we have reaſon to vary from that opinion, with reverence to thoſe worthy men: For God did not ſay in the 9th of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> I will make or create my Bow in the Cloud, but, <hi>I do ſet my Bow in the Cloud, and it ſhall be there for a token of a Covenant between me and the Earth.</hi> The Rainbow had no ſuch ſignification, nor was it ſet in the Cloud for any ſuch pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, before that time. So then,</p>
                  <p>Take the Rainbow as to its myſtical uſe, ſo I grant, it was not before the Flood; till then God had never cauſed the light of his Cloud to ſhine as a Covenant-token. The Rainbow, had alwayes a natural ſignification in it, but that is not all, it hath now alſo a Theological, divine and myſtical ſignification, and is become as the Seal of that Covenant with mankind; for God inſtituted the Rainbow as a Sacramental ſign (ſo we may expreſſe it for our bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter underſtanding) both between himſelf and the whole World in general, and in ſpecial between himſelf &amp; his Covenant people (<hi>Gen.</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 12, 13, 14, 15.) It was given (I ſay) on purpoſe to Seal the truth of the Promiſe, that the whole Earth ſhould no more be overwhelm'd with a Deluge or Flood of water: Which though it be ſuch a promiſe as the whole Creation hath the benefit of, yet the faithfull only underſtand the myſterie of it, and have their faith exerciſed upon it, and ſtrengthened by it. So that while the Rainbow is the ſign of a temporal Covenant to all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the godly may look upon it, with reference to all ſpiritual and eternal mercies by Chriſt, in whom all the promiſes of mercy are <hi>Yea and Amen,</hi> (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20.) And there is a g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eat fitneſs in it to hold forth mercy both temporal and ſpiritual, in ſeveral particulars.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, This Rainbow is in the Cloud, and God placed it in the Cloud, becauſe out of the Cloud came the Rain which drowned the old world. God could have drowned the world only by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out, or breaking up the Springs of water from the earth, but he opened the Cataracts of Heaven alſo to do it. And therefore God, to ſecure the world againſt ſuch another vengeance from the Clouds, put his Bow in the Cloud.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond ſignificancy of mercy in the Rainbow, is, becauſe the Bow is bended upwards, or Heaven-ward, the Bow doth not ſtand bent to the Earth, or downward, the ſtring of the Bow is towards us, not the back of it. He that would ſhoot hath the bottom or
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:48335:282"/> back of the Bow in his hand, and the ſtring is towards himſelf; but God, that he might ſhew he doth not intend to ſhoot that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row any more, holds the ſtring of the Bow downwards, which no man doth that hath a mind to ſhoot. The Lord by this Bow in the Cloud ſhoots no man, unleſſe it be (as one well expreſſeth it) with admiration and love; or I may ſay, the Lord having ſhot his Arrowes of immoderate Rain from the Region of the air for mans chaſtning, ſeems to return to Heaven with his Bow reverſed, as a token of peace and ſerenity to the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ld, or that in Judgment he remembers his Covenant-mercy. The wicked are ſaid to <hi>bend their Bow, they make ready their arrow upon the ſtring, that they may privily ſhoot at the upright in heart,</hi> (Pſal. 11.2.) But he that tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ns the ſtring of his Bow downwards, is not ready, nor ſeems minded to ſhoot at all.</p>
                  <p>Thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>dly, This bow ſhews mercy, becauſe there is no Arrow ſeen at it, or with it.</p>

                  <p>Fifthly, When-ever the Rainbow appears, there is clearneſs in ſome part of the air; for it cannot be but when the Sun ſhines. In the time of the Flood the light of the Sun was wholly obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.

                     </note> yet the light of the day ſhall not ceaſe.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, The various colours of the Rainbow are very ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant for our comfort, making (as ſome Naturaliſts have told us) a thouſand ſweet delights for the eye, by the admirable mixtures and ſhadowings of colours therein diſcernable.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, The Natu al Hiſtorian aſſureth us, that where the Rainbow at any time toucheth the Earth (as we may often obſerve it doth) it leaveth a fragrant ſmell upon the graſs, ſhrubs and
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:48335:282"/> buſhes. Thus you ſee how properly and fitly the Rainbow is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>The ſhining of the light of his Cloud,</hi> as alſo what ſignifications of favour are diſcernable in it. From this explication of the words, we may note;

Now though Jeſus Chriſt in the providential or mediatorial government of his Churches, doth often ſend Clouds upon them, and though Clouds and darkneſs are round about him, yet the Throne hath a Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow about it: And why a Rainbow? to ſhew that Jeſus Chriſt is mindfull of his Churches and people, to ſave them when the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent caſts out Floods to drown them. 'Tis ſaid (<hi>Rev:</hi> 12.15.) <hi>The Serpent caſt out of his mouth water as a Flood after the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that he might cauſe her to be carried away of the Flood;</hi> but Jeſus Chriſt that ſitteth upon the Throne, hath a Rainbow about h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Though Chriſt may ſuffer great Floods of ſorrow and tribulation to be powred
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:48335:283"/> upon them, yet there is a Rainbow about the Throne to which we may look, and get our faith confirmed, that the Woman and her Seed ſhall not be ſwallowed up.</p>
                  <p>Take one place more (<hi>Rev.</hi> 10.1.) <hi>I ſaw another mighty An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel coming down from heaven</hi> (that was Jeſus Chriſt) <hi>cloathed with a cloud</hi> (that is, with dark diſpenſations, ſuch as his people ſhould not well know what to make of; but what follows?) <hi>and a Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow was on his head.</hi> That Propheſie leads into a deſcription of the greateſt preſſures and troubles that ever the Church of God was to ſuffer in this world.

<pb n="549" facs="tcp:48335:283"/> in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> it is not ſaid, that the Lord ſwore; but the Lord to ſhew that his word is as good as his oath, tells us that what he ſpake to <hi>Noah,</hi> was as if he had ſworn it, eſpecially ſeeing he gave ſuch a ſign for the performance of it. I might ſhew from other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that God is ſometimes repreſented ſwearing, when yet we read of no oath formally given: It is ſaid (<hi>Exod.</hi> 32.13.) God ſware to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed; to which the Apoſtle refers (<hi>Heb.</hi> 6.13, 17.) <hi>God confirmed it by an oath;</hi> yet if we look thoſe ſcriptures, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.2, 3. <hi>Ch.</hi> 15.7. <hi>Ch.</hi> 17.7. we find only the <hi>Lord ſaid,</hi> &amp;c. The Lords ſaying is as good that is, as ſure as his ſwearing, and ſhall as certainly be performed.</p>
                  <p>For a concluſion of this matter; let it be remembred, that the Lord by <hi>cauſing the light of his Cloud to ſhine,</hi> at firſt gave, and ſtill gives a ſign, or a ſeal to ſtrengthen faith. Signs and ſeals are appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices to the Covenant, or great Charter of all our mercies. Signs and ſeales are viſible words, God ſpeaks by them to the eye. <hi>I will ſet my Bow in the Cloud;</hi> God ſaith, the Bow ſhall be a ſign, he alſo hath made Water a ſign in the holy Sacrament of Baptiſme, and he hath made Bread and Wine ſignes in the holy Sacrament of the Supper; God hath been pleaſed, from the beginning ſo far to condeſcend to mans weakneſs, as to give him, not only his Word or Promiſe, but Signes to confirm it. And therefore did the Lord give a ſign, becauſe, as himſelf hath both an all-ſufficient power, and full purpoſe to performe his promiſe, ſo he would have the faith of all that are under the Covenant well aſſured of his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in performing it.</p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee the ſpiritual uſefulneſs of this interpretation, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>the light of his Cloud,</hi> for that illuſtrious ſign the Rain-bow ſet by God in the Cloud, and moſt fitly called <hi>the light ſhining in his Cloud;</hi> which he doth not cauſe to ſhine ordinarily or every day as the Sun doth, but at ſpecial times, teſtifying his eminent fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſome, and his care over all mankind. <hi>Knoweſt thou when he cauſed the light of his Cloud to ſhine?

Can any man do this? Can any man fully underſtand how ſuch vaſt bodies as the Clouds ſhould be poiſed or ballanced? how they hover over our heads, and are kept from falling upon us? We muſt have recourſe to the wiſdome and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<q>If man knoweth not the ballancing of the Clouds, then much leſs can he ballance them. <hi>And</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Note;
<q>'Tis by a divine power that the Clouds are upheld and bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanced.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>All heavy things tens downward; what then but God keeps the Clouds up, which are ſo heavy? 'Tis a wonder that we have not Seas of waters, rather than ſhowers poured upon us from the Clouds. They that travaile far at Sea, ſee the Rain coming down by ſpouts, or like a flood in ſome places; and certainly the Clouds would come down every where like a ſtood if God did not hold them up. From which particular inſtance <hi>Elihu</hi> would have us take up this general truth, <hi>that,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>All things are kept in an even ballance by the wiſdome and power of God.</hi> The things of the world, if God did not ballance them, how would they tumble and fall awry, yea, run to ruine! were there not a ballancing operation in the arm of God, over all the affairs and buſineſſeſs of men, what a hudle and confuſion would all be in? We read in Scripture of foure things which God is ſaid to weigh or to ballance, they are all very conſiderable.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It is ſaid, God weigheth the waters (<hi>Job.</hi> 28.25.) which may be underſtood, not only of the waters above in the Clouds,
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:48335:284"/> but of the waters alſo in the Sea; he knows to a dram, to a grain, how much all the waters weigh.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Which are alſo vaſt things, It is ſaid (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.12.) <hi>He weigheth the mountains in ſcales, &amp; the hills in a ballance.</hi> And as both theſe are true taken litterally, ſo they are true alſo if you take them myſtically or metaphorically. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>John</hi> was ſhewed <hi>the judgment of the great whore,</hi> in a viſion, who <hi>ſitteth upon many waters</hi> (Rev. 17.1.) Who are meant by waters is explained there (v. 15.) even <hi>Peoples, and Multitudes, Nations, and Tongues.</hi> The people of the world are compared to waters, and well they may, fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> their inſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſtable they are as water</hi> (Gen. 49.4.) and for their aptneſs to ſwell and riſe up into floods. Now the Lord weigheth theſe myſticall Waters, Multitudes, and Nations: he knows ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly what they a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e, what they would be, and what they would do. And as by waters common people or nations, ſo by mountaines and hills the great the mighty ones of the nations are expreſt; Princes and honourable men are as great mountains. Thus ſpake the Prophet, <hi>The day of the Lord ſhall be againſt the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains (Iſa.</hi> 2.) that is, againſt the mighty men of this world; Hence that deriding queſtion, <hi>Who art thou O great mountain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Zerubbabel?</hi> (Zac. 4.7.) That is, O thou great man, who art thou? ſurely, thou art not ſo much as a mole-hil before the God of <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> who when he <hi>comes down, the mountaines melt down at his preſence</hi> (Iſa. 64.1.) who, <hi>if he doth but touch the mountains, they ſmoake</hi> (Pſal. 144.5.) as if ſtruck with Thunder. God weighs theſe mountains of the earth, that is, he conſiders and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands them exactly. God weighed him who was the greateſt mountain, of a man, in his time; <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> was the ſole Monarch of the earth, he had almoſt the whole known world at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, yet the Lord ſaid of him (<hi>Dan.</hi> 5.22.) <hi>Thou art numbred, thou art weighed, and thou art found too light.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, As God weigheth men of all ſorts, ſo he weigheth the actions of all ſorts of men (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.3.) <hi>By him actions are weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> that is, all actions are weighed by him; the leaſt actions are weighed by the mighty God, and ſo are the greateſt, he knoweth how to poyſe them, and ſo make uſe of them, that they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ct what is anſwerable to his own counſel and purpoſe. This is it which the Prophet intended, when he ſaid of the Lord, <hi>Thou moſt upright doſt weigh the path of the Just (Iſa.</hi> 26.7.) that is, the motions,
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:48335:285"/> and goings, or doings of the Juſt. The pathes of the Juſt come often into very uneven ballances in this world, every one will be weighing them, one gives this judgement of them, and another that, few hit right, the moſt of men being either blinded with igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of them, or prej<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h malice againſt them: But the comfort of the juſt is, the <hi>most upright weigheth their path,</hi> and will give the juſt weight of them.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly and laſtly, God weigheth the very ſpirits of men. <hi>All the wayes of man are clean in his own eyes, but the Lord weigheth the ſpirits</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 16.2.) The Lord doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weigh actions and pathes, that is, the whole outward courſe and tenour of our lives, but he weighs our ſpirits, that is, the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples from which our actions flow, and by which we are carried on in our pathes; he findes one man to be of a light, of a vain ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and another man to be of a proud high ſpirit, a third to be of a covetous, having, holding ſpirit; a fourth of an envious ſpirit, that cannot bear the good of another; and a fifth to be of a reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſpirit, that wil do another as much hurt as he can. Again, the Lord by weighing finds out them, whoſoever they are, that have a weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſerious ſpirit, that have an upright ſincere ſpirit, that have a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly gracious ſpirit; God knowes who they are that have a ſpirit for the things and wayes of God in the midſt of all contradictions of men; and having thus weighed the ſpirits of men, he diſpoſeth of them and deals with them accordingly. And I may add this to the queſtion in the text, Doſt thou know the ballancing of ſpirits? Surely no, for <hi>thou knoweſt not the ballancing of the Clouds</hi> (which may be known much eaſier)
<q>The wonderous works of him which is perfect in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> renders, <hi>The miracles of the perfect in knowledge.</hi> As if he had ſaid; the ſhining of the light in his Cloud, and the ballancing of the Clouds, are to be numbred among the wonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous works of him <hi>that is perfect in knowledge. The wonderouſneſs of Gods works</hi> was touched at the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, I ſhall not ſtay upon that here; only mark how <hi>Elihu</hi> deſcribes God by a periphraſis or circumlocution; he doth not ſay the wonderful works of God, but, <hi>the wonderful works of him</hi>
                     <q>

                  </p>
                  <p>This is a deſcription of God, and ſuch a deſcription as will fit none but God; who hath and who only hath, not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nly knowledge, but the perfection of it. We need not name God, when we ſpeak of him that is perfect in knowledge, it can be meant of none but him. <hi>Elihu,</hi> at the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe of the former Chapter, ſaid to <hi>Job, He that is perfect in knowledge</hi> (meaning himſelf, as that text was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded) <hi>is with thee.</hi> In what ſenſe <hi>Elihu</hi> might ſay of himſelf, that he was <hi>perfect in knowledge,</hi> was there ſhewed; and here it muſt be ſhewed and confeſſed, that neither <hi>Elihu</hi> was, nor any, the moſt knowing, are perfect in knowledge like God, or as God is. The Apoſtle ſaith of the beſt knowers in this world (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.9.) <hi>We know in part, and we propheſie in part; we behold dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as in a glaſs.</hi> They that have the cleareſt eye-ſight, the pureſt intellectuals, know but in part, and ſee but darkly, which is far from perfectly; therefore, I ſay, this deſcription <hi>of perfect in knowledge,</hi> hath a peculiar meaning here, proper only to God, as will appear more particularly in opening this Obſervation from it.</p>
                  <q>God is not only full of knowledge, but perfect in knowledge; <hi>or,</hi> The knowledge of God is perfectly perfect.</q>
                  <p>That's perfectly perfect to which nothing can be added, and from which nothing can be taken. Such is the knowledge of God; it is impoſſible to add any thing to it, and it is as impoſſible to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh it: God cannot forget or unlearn any thing already known, nor can he know any more things, no nor any thing mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>fect; For,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>He knoweth all things;</hi> what-ever is knowable he knoweth. He knowes</p>

                  <p>Secondly, He knowes all things preſent.</p>

                  <p>Fifthly, He knowes all things unerringly; he knoweth them ſo as there is not the leaſt miſtake in his knowledge; that's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect knowledg.

                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, He knowes all things everlaſtingly; all things are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him alwayes. Some men quite lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Fifthly, If God be perfect in knowledge, <hi>Then he fully knows the needs of his people all the world over;</hi> he knowes the ſtate of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one for ſoul and body. This Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thus <hi>Elihu</hi> cometh nearer to <hi>Job</hi> than before, not only convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him of his ignorance in thoſe things which were far above him, but even in thoſe that were about him; not only with reſpect to the Clouds of heaven, but to the cloathes upon his ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

                  <p>Fourthly, (Which is the common uſe of garments, and that which the text ſpeaks of) they are for warmth, to keep out the cold, and to defend us from the injuries and violence of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; yet we ſca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And becauſe the Heavens are called a Looking-Glaſſe, it ſhould mind us to look upon the Heavens; they may mind us,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, What God is, who hath made the Heavens (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.1.) <hi>The Heavens declare the glory of God, and the Firmament ſheweth his handy work.</hi> We may ſee God by the Heavens;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In his nature, that he is pure and holy. He that hath made ſuch a pure thing as the Heaven is, how pure is he! There is no dirt in the Sky, no filth in the Heavens, no uncleanneſs there; the duſt or filth of this world can get but a little into the air, it cannot reach the Heavens. The purity of God is ſuch as may ſhame the purity of the Heavens, and make them bluſh; though the Heavens are the pureſt part of the world, yet compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively to God they are impure. This <hi>Eliphaz</hi> aſſerts expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (<hi>Chap.</hi> 15.15.) <hi>Behold, he putteth no truſt in his Saints, yea, the Heavens are not clean in his ſight. Biluad</hi> puts it yet further (<hi>Chap.</hi> 26.5.) <hi>Yea, the Starrs</hi> (which are the moſt pure and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplendent part of the Heavens) <hi>are not pure in his ſight.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Heavens are a Glaſſe, wherein we may behold the power of God. How unconceiveable is his power, who hath made ſuch a Canopie, and ſpread it over the heads of all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures! And if the viſible Heavens are ſo glorious, what is the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of Heavens! The Heaven which we ſee, is but the pavement of that which is unſeen. God hath made ſuch a Ceeling for this Houſe below, as never needed mending, or repaire, he hath ſet ſuch a Roof upon it as abides all weathers.</p>

The light of the Sun is clear and ſhines into our eyes, yet there is a difficulty to underſtand the nature of Light.

                  <p>Secondly, Foraſmuch as <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith, <hi>We cannot order our ſpeech by reaſon of darkneſs;</hi> we, though knowing men, know not what to ſay.</p>
                  <p>Note;
<q>There is much darkneſs remaining in thoſe that have moſt light in this world.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>They that know much and have the cleareſt ſight, are yet dark in many things; what they ſee is but little to what they ſee not (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.9.) <hi>We know but in part,</hi> and (<hi>verſ.</hi> 12.) <hi>We ſee through a glaſs darkly.</hi> The ſight that we have of things, though in a Goſpel-way, is but a kind of dark ſight, <hi>we ſee through a glaſs darkly. Elihu</hi> ſaw himſelf compaſt about with much darkneſs; and who may not find darkneſs yet abiding in him? What-ever our light or knowledge is, all that we know is not half ſo much as that which we know not; this ſhould humble us. We are very apt to
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:48335:301"/> be proud of that knowledge we have <hi>(Knowledge puffs up)</hi> but did we remember how much ignorance is mixed and amaſſed with our knowledge, how much darkneſs with our light, we ſhould ſee little reaſon to be proud of it, or pufft up with it.</p>
                  <p>Take theſe Inferences of duty from this ſecond Note.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>We ſhould alwayes be praying for Light. Every good gift, and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Lights:</hi> If we would have light from the Father of lights we muſt ask it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Let the moſt ſeeing take heed of preſuming that they ſee all.</hi> Some think they know enough, yea, that they have all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, what is it that they know not? But <hi>Elihu</hi> and his friends ſaid well, <hi>We cannot order our ſpeech by reaſon of darkneſs.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If the darkneſs of ignorance be not quite diſpelled from the moſt enlightened and knowing ſouls, Then, <hi>As they who have received moſt light of knowledge, have cauſe enough to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in themſelves, ſo to beware of deſpiſing others.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, When <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith, <hi>We cannot order our ſpeech by reaſon of darkneſs,</hi>

                  <p>Seventhly, About the power and working of grace in them, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially of that grace of Faith.</p>
                  <p>If we want the grace of Faith, we know not how to order our ſpeech before God, nor can we come to God without faith (<hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6.) &amp; i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

As Faith is the evidence of thoſe things which cannot be ſeen at all by the eye of ſence, ſo it is the evidence of ſome things to us, which are very little ſeen by the eye of the underſtanding.

The words are plain, according to our tranſlation; I ſhall open them breifly as they are here ſet down, and then give out a further reading of them, which raiſes the ſcope and intendment of <hi>Elihu</hi> yet higher.</p>

                  <p>I have already at the 9th verſe of this Chapter, ſhewed the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral uſes which God hath appoynted the winds unto, both in a way of Mercy, and of Judgment: They purge the air, they ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Clouds for Rain, they ſcatter them, and ſo make faire weather, they move the waters, which otherwiſe by ſtanding ſtill would putrifie, corrupt, and grow unwholſome, yea infectious both to man and beaſt, they refreſh the Earth, and cauſe all ſorts of vegetables to flouriſh, they are alſo, as it were, the food and nouriſhment, the meat and drink of mans life; there's no living without them.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not ſtay further to diſcourſe or diſcover the nature and the wonders, or the wonderfull nature of the wind, having done ſomwhat towards it (as was ſaid) before at the ninth verſe.

<pb n="601" facs="tcp:48335:309"/> and bear down all before it.

                  <p>This is true alſo if we carry it yet in a more ſpiritual way, as to thoſe Clouds of ſorrow which often darken and afflict our minds in the midſt of outward proſperity, or in the cleareſt Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine-day of peace that ever was in this world; when theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Clouds dwell, as it were, upon the ſoul, the Lord hath a wind which paſſeth and cleanſeth them away too. What is that wind? it is his holy Spirit. The word in the text,<note place="margin">Bolduc:</note> is uſed often to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, not only the natural wind in the air, but that divine wind the Holy Ghoſt, who is compared unto the wind in many places of Scripture, and his opperations are like thoſe of the wind: For <hi>as the wind bloweth where it liſteth, we hear the ſound thereof, but know not whence it cometh, nor whither it goeth; ſo</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that is born of the Spirit</hi> (John 3.8.) And as our Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is wrought by that ſecret, yet ſtrong and powerfull wind, ſo likewiſe is our conſolation. The Spirit of God doth thoſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

From all theſe Clouds
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:48335:310"/> the holy Spirit of God cleanſeth us in the work of Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And from all thoſe Clouds which trouble our Conſciences, the holy Spirit cleanſeth us in the work of Conſolation.</p>
                  <p>Some Interpreters expound the words only in this myſtical ſenſe, quite rejecting the proper. But though, by alluſion, we may improve the words to this ſpiritual ſenſe, yet doubtleſs <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeaks here of the winds properly taken, or of the natural winds, and their ſenſible effects; and ſo, according to our reading, this Text, as it hath been opened, teacheth us what ſudden changes God makes in the Air. Now the light is ſhut up, or ſhut in, and anon it is let out again, and all by the powerful hand of God, who doth adminiſter theſe things to us interchangeably, as himſelf pleaſeth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The text, according to another reading (which others inſiſt much upon, and conceive pertinent to the ſcope of <hi>Elihu</hi>) runs thus;<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Broughton</hi> tranſlates clearly ſo, his words are theſe; <hi>And now men cannot look upon the light, when it is bright in the Air, then a wind paſſeth and cleanſeth it.</hi> And then the ſence of the whole verſe is plainly a ſetting forth of the excellency, or ſuperexcellency rather, of the light of the Sun, which is ſo clear and ſplendid, that if the Air be but clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from Clouds, if it be but a pure Air, no man is able to face it, nor his eye directly to behold it. We behold all things by the light of the Sun, but no man can ſtedfaſtly behold the light in the Sun; no man can look right up to the Sun, when it caſts forth its fiery rayes, and ſhines bright upon us. And this ſome conceive ſo genuine and clear an expoſition of the Text, that the light of it may ſeem to obſcure and darken all others. Now, according to this ſecond reading, the whole verſe, with that which followeth, contains an argument to confirm the former propoſition, laid down at the 20th verſe: <hi>If a man ſpeak, he ſhall be ſwallowed up,</hi> that is, if a man come too nigh unto God, and be over-bold with him, he ſhal even be ſwallowed up of his brightneſs &amp; that it is ſo, I prove thus (ſaith <hi>El<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Again, Some taking the word <hi>gold</hi> here metaphorically for any <hi>pretious thing,</hi> take the word <hi>North</hi> metaphorically alſo for any <hi>evil thing,</hi> that is, for any affliction, trouble, or ſorrow which we meet with in this world; theſe are indeed as a cold chilling North-wind, and ſo they will needs give the ſence of this Scripture my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtically thus, <hi>Out of the North cometh precious things;</hi> that is, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions (which are as a cold chilling North-wind) make us more precious; or, through cold chilling afflictions, we are made more and more precious. <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, and this text may have ſuch an alluſion (and I give it no further) to that (<hi>Chap.</hi> 23.10.) <hi>When he hath tried me, I ſhall come forth gold;</hi> that is, I ſhall come forth precious. Whether God doth try us by the North or by the South, whether by the heat of proſperity, or by the cold of adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, if we are under his tryal, and are faithfull, we come out gold, we come out more precious from our tryals, than we came in. The Apoſtle hath a like alluſion (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.6, 7.) <hi>Ye are now for a ſeaſon in heavineſs (if need be) through manifold temptations,</hi> (that is, troubles, tribulations and afflictions) <hi>That the triall of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that periſheth,
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:48335:311"/> though it be tried with fire, might be found to praiſe,</hi> &amp;c. Thus <hi>Out of the North comes Gold, or this precious thing,</hi> a tryed faith. That's a truth from the allegorical ſenſe of this place; but I ſhall not ſtay upon it.</p>
                  <p>The proper meaning is, <hi>Elihu</hi> would have <hi>Job,</hi> and all men know, God hath his ſeveral Climates or places, out of which he ſends and diſpenceth fair and foul weather; foul weather cometh out of the South, and fair out of the North.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, In the day of Conſcience, or when their own Conſciences are a terrour to them. How ſad is it for a man to have God and his own Conſcience ter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ible to him at once! When ſinners are awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, when God ſets their ſins in order before them, they are a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to themſelves, as it is ſaid of <hi>Paſhur (Jer.</hi> 20.3.) <hi>The Lord hath not called thy name Paſhur, but Magor Miſſabib,</hi> that is, <hi>fear round about; I will make thee a terror to thy ſelf,</hi> thy own Conſcience ſhall be terrible to thee. A man had better fall into the hands of the moſt cruel Tyrants in the World, than into the hands of his own Conſcience. But when a man is a terrour to himſelf, then to have the Lord a terrour to him likewiſe, to have God appearing in terrible Majeſty, how dreadful is it! <hi>The awakened Conſcience of a ſinner carrieth in it, as a thouſand witneſſes, ſo a thouſand ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours; and God in his anger is more terrible than a thouſand conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>God is terrible to ſinners,</hi> in the day of outward trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, when, as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.5.) <hi>By terrible things in righteouſneſs he anſwereth the prayers of his People.</hi> When God is doing terrible things in the World, how miſerable is their caſe, to whom God alſo is a terrour in that day! A godly man when God is doing the moſt terrible things, <hi>ſhaking Heaven and earth,</hi> and (as it were) pulling the world about our ears, yet, becauſe he finds God at peace with him, he is well enough. But as for impenitent ſinners, when God is doing terrible things, what will become of them? I may beſpeak them in the words of the Prophet (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 10.3.) <hi>What will ye do in the day of your viſitation, and in the deſolation which ſhal come from far? to whom will ye flee for help, and where wil ye leave your glory?</hi> As if he had ſaid, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>errour to you? And therefore, another Prophet fore-ſeing ſuch a terrible day coming, makes this earneſt deprecating prayer (<hi>Jer.</hi> 17.13.) <hi>O Lord, be not thou a terr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ur to me in the evil day.</hi> I know an evil, a terrible day is at hand, but Lord I beg this of thee, that thou wilt not be a terrour to me in that day; if men ſhould be a terrour to me, and God a terrour
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:48335:314"/> too, it would be in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thirdly, How terrible is God to impenitent ſinners (when awakened) in the day of death! What is Death? In this Book Death is called <hi>The King of Terrours.</hi> Now, if when Dea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

To have Death the King of Terrours, and the Living, the ever-liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God in terrible Majeſty falling upon a poor creature at once, is a thouſand deaths at once.</p>

                  <p>In the 23d verſe we have a four-fold Doctrine held out con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God.</p>

                  <p>Thirdly, Of his Righteouſneſs, he excells <hi>in Judgement, and plenty of Juſtice.</hi> But though he is thus full of Juſtice, yet he is alſo very Gracious, and therefore,</p>

                     <hi>Touching the Almighty,</hi> we have but this to ſay of him, <hi>We cannot ſay much of him,</hi> or, <hi>how much ſoever we ſay of him, we ſay but a little of what he is,</hi> or <hi>of what may be ſaid of him, for we cannot find him out.</hi> We may find God, but we cannot find him out.

                     </gap>t more ſtrictly, to <hi>ſeek him while he may be found</hi> (as one of the Rabbins gloſſeth that place) is to ſeek him before the Decree comes forth, as the Prophet <hi>Zephany</hi> ſpeaks (<hi>Chap.</hi> 2.2.) It is poſſible we may ſeek God, and ſeek him too late, and then there's no finding of him; Only they ſhall ſeek and find him, who ſeek him in the finding time, and they who do ſo ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly find, as was ſaid before, God ready to do them good, and ſhew them mercy.</p>
                  <p>But how much ſoever, or how early ſoever we ſeek him, we cannot find him out, that is, we cannot find out how good, how merciful God is, or the utmoſt extent of his goodneſs and mercy, which <hi>Zophar</hi> in the place before cited, calleth a <hi>finding of him out to perfection.</hi> I may give you a five-fold Negative to ſhew wherein God cannot be found out.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, We cannot find him out, as to the excellency of his Attributes, or the manner of his being; who can tell how wiſe God is, how holy, how juſt, how powerful, how good! We may eaſily find his divine perfections all the world over, we may find them in every leaf of the book of the Scripture, yea, in every leaf of the book of the Creature, but we cannot find them out any where to perfection.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We cannot find out the depth of his Counſels. God hath ſome <hi>(Arcana)</hi> ſecrets which he hath reſerved in his own
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:48335:317"/> power, as Chriſt told his diſciples in the firſt of the <hi>Acts (verſ.</hi> 6.) when they would needs be prying into that ſecret of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, <hi>the time of reſtoring the kingdom to Iſrael.</hi> There are many councels of God lockt up in his own bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Fourthly, The Lord cannot be found out, no not in his works of P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

There are many providences of God, which we find and feel, which we ſee, and cannot but ſee, yet we cannot find them out, that is, we are not able to give a direct anſwer why God doth this or that, nor how this or that was done. Conſider that Scripture (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 31.20, 21.) where we have a moſt ſingular character of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and of his government; <hi>Thus did Hez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rk that he began in the ſervice of the houſe of God, he did it with all his heart, and proſpered.</hi> So the 31<hi rend="sup">th</hi> chapter concludes; yet the 32d be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins thus, <hi>After theſe things, and the eſtabliſhment thereof, Senna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherib King of Aſſiria came and entred into Judah, and encamped a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the fenced Cities.</hi> One would have thought, <hi>Hezekiah</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus zealous for the Reformation of the Church of God, in <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and having done all that concerned it with a perfect heart, that ſurely ſuch a Prince ſhould have lived in peace and proſpered all his dayes; yet, preſently his Kingdome was invaded by a potent enemy, <hi>Sennacherib</hi> comes againſt him, and fills him, and all his people, with fear of utter ſubverſion. This was a ſecret of providence, very hard to find out, a depth, which who can fathome? That when a good King with his Counſel, had been indeavouring a true Reformation, and that with a perfect heart, he ſhould preſently ſee war at his gates. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith (<hi>Pro.</hi> 16.7.) <hi>When a mans ways pleaſe the Lord, he makes his enemies to

                  <p>Fifthly, Take this alſo; We cannot find out God in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of his Free Grace in the Goſpel; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s in Jeſus Ch iſt, as (though it be our duty to be ſearching after them, and in them, all our dayes, though we ought to be continually digging in thoſe golden Mines, to find out the treaſures hidden there, yet) we can never find them out. Therefore the Apoſtle (<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.8) calls them, <hi>The unſearchable riches of Chriſt;</hi> not, <hi>unſearchable,</hi> becauſe it is unlawful to ſearch after them, but, <hi>unſearchable,</hi> becauſe when we have ſearched to the utmoſt we cannot find them out; as he ſpeaks in the cloſe of that chapter; <hi>that we may be able to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend with all Saints, the height and depth, and length, and breadth, and to know the love of Chriſt that paſſeth knowledge.</hi> Under all theſe conſiderations (and many, many more) God is paſt finding out. Whence take three brief Inferences.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Do not ſearch too far</hi> (that is, beyond what is written) <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the counſels of God, no nor into the works of God.</hi> For though, as it is ſaid (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 111.2.) <hi>the works of God are great, ſought out by all them that have pleaſure therein;</hi> yet they that have the greateſt pleaſure in them, cannot in all points find them out. It is our duty to ſearch the works of God, but to think we can find out the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of his works would be our ſin.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If the Almighty cannot be found out, no not in his works of providence, then, <hi>Take heed of cenſuring or finding fault with his works.</hi> Shall we cenſure what we cannot know, and find fault with that which we cannot find? He that cenſures what ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth, ſhould firſt have the full compaſs of what he doth, and be able to look quite thorow it, which the moſt eagle-eyed ſoul in the world cannot, as to what God doth in this world. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though you ſee no reaſon for what is don, do not complain, for there may be a reaſon for the doing of it, which you do not ſee; and the reaſon is often ſuch, and lyes ſo deep, that you cannot ſee it. And know this is reaſon enough, why you ſhould forbear cenſuring what is done, becauſe God doth i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     </gap>her reaſon why it is done.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>If God be paſt finding out in his works, and much more
<pb n="618" facs="tcp:48335:318"/> in himſelf, then be not ſo much as diſcontented with his works.</hi> You are not yet come to the bottom, you have not ſeen the laſt man born (as we ſay) you know not what God will make of it, till he hath done all; therefore take heed of murmuring and diſcontent, (<hi>Zech.</hi> 2.13.) <hi>Be ſilent, O all fleſh, before the Lord, for he is riſen out of his holy habitation.</hi> Though his riſing be viſible, yet we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee all the concernments and intendments of his riſing; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be ſil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>There is a two-fold power of God, and in both he is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, His commanding power, his power of Soveraignty, or Authority; that's a moſt excellent power, 'tis a power over all, whether things or perſons.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, His power of working or effecting that which he commands. Some have a power of commanding, yet want a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of working, they want a power to effect that which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: but whatſoever God hath a mind to command, he hath an hand to effect and bring it about; he can carry on his work through all the difficulties and deficiencies which it meets with in or by the creature; He can do his wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>k though there be none to help him in it, though all forſake him, and with-draw from his work; yea, he often worketh though there be not ſo much as an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor to move him to work (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.16.) <hi>He ſaw that there was no man</hi> (to do any thing) <hi>and wondered that there was no Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor</hi> to entreat him to do ſomewhat for them. Things were in a great exigency, and there was not only no man that would put forth a hand, but there was no man that would beſtow a word for redreſs, no man would beſpeak either God or men for help: What then? muſt the work ſtand ſtill or miſcarry? no, ſaith the text, <hi>His own arm brought ſalvation unto him,</hi> that is, ſet it ready at hand for him to beſtow upon his people; or, his own arm brought that ſalvation to his people, which they greatly needed, and he graciouſly intended, though he had not the contribution of a word towards it from any creature here below, one or other. God alone is ſelf-ſufficient, and to man All-ſufficient. Such is the working power of God, that he can work, not only when he hath but a little help, but when he hath no help at all.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The excellency of the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Lord is ſo excellent in power, that he both can and will do his work through
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:48335:319"/> all oppoſition; though mountains ſtand in his way, though rocks ſtand in his way, he will remove them, or work through them. (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.13) <hi>I will work, and who ſhall lett it?</hi> Neither ſtrength nor craft, neither multitude nor magnitude, neither the many nor the mighty can lett it, if the Lord undertake it. Take a double In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference from this.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, 'Tis matter of great comfort to all that fear God in their weakeſt condition and loweſt reducements, when they are fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs, and have none to help them. As the Lord is excellent in his wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Apoſtle ſaith of himſelf (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.10.) <hi>When I am weak, then am I ſtrong,</hi> that is, then have I the ſtrength of the Lord coming into my help. And as it is with reſpect to particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſo to the whole <hi>generation of his children, when they are weak, then are they ſtrong,</hi> that is, then they have the ſtrong God, the God <hi>excellent in power,</hi> appearing and working for them.</p>

                     </gap>o is a ſad word to all that ſtand in the way of Gods working power; His working power quickly works through all power, and can work it down. <hi>Babylon</hi> is a mighty powerful enemy, but (<hi>Rev.</hi> 18.8.) we read of the downfal of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and that her ruine ſhall come as in one day: But, how ſhall this be effected? The anſwer is given in the cloſe of the verſe, <hi>For ſtrong is the Lord God which Judgeth her.</hi> Suppoſe there ſhould be no power in the world ſtrong enough to pull down <hi>Babylon,</hi> yea, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe all the powers in the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Babylon;</hi> 'tis otherwiſe propheſied, for, <hi>the Kings of the earth ſhall hate the whore and ſhall make her deſolate, and naked, and eate her fleſh, and burn her with fire;</hi> but ſuppoſe, I ſay, all earthly power ſhould appear for, rather than againſt <hi>Babylon,</hi> yet this is enough for us to reſt in, <hi>ſtrong is the Lord which Judgeth her. He is excellent in power,</hi> and as it followeth,
<q>In Judgment.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This comes in, leſt any ſhould think, becauſe God is ſo excelent in power, ſo mighty in ſtrength, that therefore he would carry things by violence or by meer force, as the ſons of men, the mighty <hi>Nimrods</hi> of the world ſomtimes do: If they have ſtrength
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:48335:319"/> and power to do ſuch or ſuch things, they regard not Judgment nor Juſtice, they look not whether right or wrong; therefore <hi>Elihu,</hi> when he had ſaid, God <hi>is excellent in power,</hi> preſently adds, <hi>and in Judgment.</hi> As if he had ſaid, <hi>Though the Lord excel all in power, and is able to cruſh the mightyeſt as a moth, yet he will not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs any by his power; the worſt of men ſhall find the Lord as much in judgment and righteouſneſs, as he is in ſtrength and power. And therefore, O Job, be aſſured, God hath not done thee any wrong, nor ever will.</hi> This I conceive to be the ſcope of <hi>Elihu</hi> in the connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe two, The excellency of God in <hi>Judgment,</hi> as well as <hi>in Power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what are we to underſtand by <hi>judgment,</hi> in which <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith God excells? In anſwer to this Querie I ſhall firſt ſhew that <hi>Judgment</hi> is taken four ways in Scripture, and then prove that God is excellent in Judgment, with reſpect to every one of them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Judgment <hi>is an ability of judging.</hi> A man of judgment, and a wiſe man are the ſame. When we ſay, ſuch a man, is a man of Judgment, or a judicious man, we mean, he is a prudent man, he is able to diſcern things that differ, he knows how to order, ſtate and determine doubtful things aright. In this ſence we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it here, the Lord <hi>is excellent in judgment,</hi> that is, in wiſdome and prudence to ſet things right, and to give every one his right, he ſees clearly how to mannage all his affayres and purpoſes by righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous meanes to right ends. The prophet gives God the glory of this title expreſſely (<hi>Iſa</hi> 30.18.) <hi>The Lord is a God of judgment: Bleſſed are they that wait for him.</hi> That is, the Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d is infinitely furniſhed with wiſdom, he knows exactly, not only what ought to be done, but how and when to do it; therefore waite for him. And 'tis encouragement to waite, when we have a perſon of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and underſtanding, a diſcreet and prudent perſon to waite upon. God is a God of judgment, in this ſence, <hi>theref re bleſſed are they that waite for him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Judgement in Scripture is taken for that modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or due meaſure, which is obſerved in any thing that is done. This follows the former; for unleſs a man have a Judgment or true underſtanding in the thing it ſelf, he can never hit a right meaſure of it. Thus, I conceive, that Scripture is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood (<hi>Math</hi> 23.23.) where Chriſt denouncing or thundering out woes thick and threefold againſt the proud hypocritical Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees,
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:48335:320"/> he tells them, <hi>Ye pay tythe of Aniſe and Cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the Law, Judgment, Mercy;</hi> that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, either they did not give a right judgment according to Law, or their legal Judgments were given with rigour, not at all attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd, mixt, and moderated with mercy. Of ſuch the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſpeaketh (<hi>Chap.</hi> 2.13.) <hi>He ſhall have judgment without mercy that hath ſhewed no mercy, and mercy rejoyceth against Judgment.</hi> In this ſence the Lord <hi>is excellent in Judgment;</hi> For as he hath wiſdome and underſtanding to ſee what is juſt &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ight, ſo in Judgment he remembers Mercy: His patience is grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he gives Judgment; and his moderation is great when he gives it. <hi>He dealeth not with us according to our ſins, nor rewardeth us according to our iniquities,</hi> (Pſal. 103.10.) that is, his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are not proportion'd to the greatneſs of our ſins and iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; <hi>For</hi> (as it followeth at the 11th verſe of that <hi>Pſalme) as high as the Heave<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> is above the Earth, ſo great is his mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them that feare him.</hi> Therefore the Prophet brings in the Chu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ch praying thus (<hi>Jer.</hi> 10.24.) <hi>O Lord, Correct me</hi> (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it is not a direct prayer for Correction, but a ſubmiſſion to it: As if he had ſaid, I will not murmur, nor rebell againſt thy Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; <hi>O Lord, Correct me) but with Judgment,</hi> that is, with due moderation: It cannot be meant of Judgment, as it notes the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of divine diſpleaſure, but Correct me moderately, or, as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther text hath i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ation; we quickly exceed our limits, if carried out in paſſion; and though, that anger which the Scripture attributes often to God, never tranſports him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the due bounds of his wiſdome and juſtice, yet when God is ſaid to do a thing in anger, it notes his going, as it were, to the utmoſt bounds of juſtice; this cauſed the Church to pray, O Lord, if the cup may not paſs from me, if it cannot be, but I muſt be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, then I humbly and earneſtly beg, thou wouldſt be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>to correct me in Judgment, not in anger, leaſt thou bring me to nothing.</hi> What the Church prayed for here, the Lord promiſed elſewhere (<hi>Jer.</hi> 30.11.) <hi>I will not make a full end of thee, but I will correct thee in meaſure, and will not leave thee altogether unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.</hi> Thus God is excellent in Judgment: He abates the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:48335:320"/> of his proceedings, and allayes the bitterneſs of the cup by ſome ingredients of mercy.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Judgment in Scripture is put for the reformation of things when they are out of order. In this ſence it is uſed (<hi>John</hi> 12.31.) <hi>Now is the Judgment of this world.</hi> Our late Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors tell us, that by Judgment is meant reformation: As if Chriſt had ſaid, <hi>I am come to ſet all things in order, that have been out of order and disjoynted in the Jewiſh Church, and every where elſe; Now is the Judgment of this world.</hi> In this ſence God is excellent in Judgment, or he excells in this Judgment, that is, he is for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, he will ſet all things right, he will make crooked things ſtrait, he will make the rough places plain. <hi>John</hi> the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt came before Chriſt in this work, yet in this work Chriſt is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or exceeds <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt. <hi>The Lord</hi> (Iſa. 4.4.) <hi>will purge away the iniquity of the daughter of Zion with a ſpirit of Judgment, and with a ſpirit of burning,</hi> that is, with a reforming and a refin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirit: And the Lord will <hi>ſend forth this Judgment unto victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> (Matth. 12.20.) that is, he will do it thorowly, he will ove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>od would work upon themſelves, in taking away their droſs and tinn, <hi>Reſtoring their Judges as at the firſt, and their Councellers as at the beginning.</hi> Such a Judgment is ſpoken of (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 30 22.) <hi>Ye ſhall defile alſo</hi> (that is, utterly diſgrace and deface) <hi>the Covering of thy graven Images of Silver, and the Ornament of thy molten Images of Gold; thou ſhalt caſt them away as a menſtruous cloth, thou ſhalt ſay unto it, get thee hence.</hi> This is the Judgment of reformation, which
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:48335:321"/> God hath and will further work among his people, till <hi>Sion be built up in perfect beauty, and Jeruſalem become the praiſe of the whole earth.</hi> Thus alſo God is excellent both <hi>in power</hi> and <hi>in Judgment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Judgment ſignifies thoſe evills which God brings upon impenitent ſinners; that's a very frequent notion of <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in Scripture, and the Lord is excellent in this Judgment; and that</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Upon his own people, when they provoke him and ſin againſt him (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.17.) <hi>If Judgment begin at the houſe of God, what ſhall the end be of them that obey not the Goſpel.</hi> There's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment beginning at the houſe of God, that is, God will bring evill upon his own houſe, the Church, even ſore troubles and perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The Lord will not ſpare them, who have been ſlight with him, forgetfull of him, formal in profeſſion, or wanton and vaine in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. This is a great part of the Lords excellency in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he brings Judgment upon his own houſe. <hi>The Lord,</hi> ſaith the Prophet (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.16.) <hi>ſhall be exalted in Judgment, and God that is holy ſhall be ſanctified in righteouſneſs,</hi> that is, in bringing his righteous Judgments upon <hi>Iſrael,</hi> his peculiar people. We find that Goſpel Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> often interweaving the wyre and whipcord of corporal bondage, with the ſilk and ſcarlet thread of <hi>Sions</hi> d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>liverances.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In Judgment towards his enemies (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 149.9.) <hi>He will execute on them the Judgment that is written,</hi> and that is no inconſiderable, nor eaſie Judgment. The ſervants of God may ſmart ſorely under theſe Judgments, but the wicked and rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſhall periſh, and ſink under them. How dreadfull is that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion or proteſtation which the Lord made by <hi>Moſes (Deut.</hi> 32.41.) <hi>If I whet my glittering ſword, and my hand take hold of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward them that hate me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some, poſſibly, may object, Surely there is no ſuch appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Gods excellency in Judgment upon the wicked of the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

There was ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a great ſcarcity of Juſtice in the Juſticers of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> when the Lord by his Prophet (<hi>Jer.</hi> 5.1.) offered to pardon the whole City, if upon the ſending forth of his W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>it of Enquiry, the name of any one man could be returned that executed Judgment. O that Dearth of Juſtice! and in what place may we hope to find plenty of juſtice among men, when ſo little of it was to be found in <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> the City of God? yet this may comfort us, that though there be little of it in or among men, there is plenty of it in God. And that there is plenty of juſtice in God, I would demonſtrate theſe five wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, He hath plenty of juſtice, who deals juſtly with every man. God giveth every man his due, all his due, and nothing but his due. More diſtinctly, take this in two branches. Firſt, he that rewards all that are good, with good, not this or that man, not his kinſman, or his friend only, but every man that is good, with good, he hath plenty of Juſtice: Thus doth God. The reſpect which God hath to the perſons of good men, is like the reſpect which good men have to the commands of God, it is <hi>univerſall,</hi> he reſpects them all. As they give him plentifull obedience, having a reſpect to all his Commandements, ſo he gives them plentifull Juſtice, he hath reſpect to all their perſons, to all their workings, to all their wayes, which are holy, juſt, and good. Again, Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, He hath <hi>plenty of Juſtice,</hi> who puniſheth all that do evil, not winking at, nor ſparing friends or kindred. Surely then there is plenty of juſtice in God; for as he rewards all the good with good, ſo he rewards all evil men with evil; that's all the reward they ſhall have, and they ſhall have plenty of it (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.23.) <hi>He plenteouſly rewardeth the proud doer.</hi> The proud ſhall have and drink up the laſt, the reſidue, the remainder, the very dregs of the bitter cup, of the cup of trembling, as the Hebrew elegancy uſed by the Pſalmiſt intimates. <hi>Tribulation and anguiſh upon every ſoul of man that doth evil; for there is no reſpect of perſons with God, (Rom.</hi> 2.9, 11.) As he will puniſh none but evil-doers, ſo he will puniſh them every one, except they repent.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, With the Lord is plenty of Juſtice, for he knows the whole Compaſs of Juſtice, he hath the clear Idea of it in his underſtanding, he knows all the rules of it, or rather is the rule of it. All the rules of Juſtice came out from him, and are but the
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:48335:323"/> ſignification of his own mind, therefore he muſt needs know them, and be well skilled in them. Some men have a good mind to do juſtice, yet have no plenty of it, becauſe they are unskilfull in the rule of it, the Lawes both of God and man. A Judge that is blind th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The doing of juſtice requireth ſtrength of hand, as well as ſtrength of Law, and integrity of heart. <hi>David</hi> had a good mind to do juſtice upon <hi>Joab</hi> (though neerly related to him) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

They cannot, therefore <hi>with him is plenty of Juſtice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, The Lord cannot but have plenty of juſtice, for his very natu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

A man may be unjuſt, and yet be a man, but God cannot be God, and not do juſtly. Seeing then it is his nature to do juſtice, there muſt needs be plenty of juſtice with him: And how ſevere ſoever the judgments of God are, there is nothing but juſtice in them. <hi>Juſtice, Juſtice, ſhalt thou follow,</hi> was the command of God to the Judges of <hi>Iſrael</hi> by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> that is, as we tranſlate, <hi>that which is altogether juſt ſhalt thou follow</hi> (D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

There are four things aſcribed to God in Scripture, which may aſſure us that he will be juſt in perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all his promiſes. Firſt, He remembers them all (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 111.5. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115.12.) Secondly, He is unchangeable and in one mind, (<hi>Job</hi> 23.13, 14.) Thirdly, He is the Almighty, and ever fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht with power to perform them. Fourthly, He is moſt faithfull, and will not deny nor falſifie them (<hi>Heb.</hi> 10.23.)</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This truth hath a moſt dreadfull aſpect and frownes terribly upon the ungodly and unjuſt. That <hi>God hath plenty of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,</hi> Juſtice enough to beſtow among them all, is enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found them all; though they make a Covenant with death, and with hell are at agreement, yet their Covenant and agreement ſhall be diſſolved, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.15, 16.) The Scripture ſpeaks Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice often to ſinners, ſpecially to thoſe unjuſt ones, who <hi>weigh the violence of their hands</hi> (Pſal. 58.1, 2.) that is, who oppreſs with a kind of exactneſs, who do not tumble it out palpably, or in a lump, but weigh it out, now a little, and then a little: The Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>This may ſeem at firſt hearing, a ſtrange connection; will he not afflict? how then hath he plenty of Juſtice? Doth not God afflict? who afflicts then? have men the power of affliction in their hands? or hath Satan the power of affliction in his hand? <hi>Affliction cometh not forth of the duſt, neither doth trouble ſpring out of the ground,</hi> ſaid <hi>Eliphaz</hi> (Chap. 5.6.)
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:48335:324"/> Saith not the Scripture every where, affliction comes down from heaven, or that 'tis of God? did not <hi>Job</hi> ſay (<hi>Chap.</hi> 1.21.) <hi>The Lord hath taken,</hi> that is, afflicted me, by taking away my all of this world? and doth not God himſelf ſay (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.30, 31, 32.) <hi>If his children forget my Law, I will puniſh their tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with a rod, and their iniquity with ſtripes?</hi> How then ſaith <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hu, God will not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Firſt, Though God be excellent in Judgment, and plenty of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, yet it may be ſaid, <hi>he will not afflict,</hi> becauſe in ſome ſenſe, he hath not a will to afflict, or he doth not afflict with his will, that is, he delights not to afflict, he hath declared himſelf more ready to ſhew mercy, than to execute judgment.

                  <p>Thirdly, Becauſe he doth not afflict us but when there is need (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.6.) nor more <hi>than there is need;</hi> we ſhall not be afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an hour longer, nor have a grain more of weight in the burden of our croſs, nor a drop more of gall and wormwood in the cup of our ſorrows than we have need of (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.7, 8, 9.) <hi>Hath he ſmitten him, as he ſmote thoſe that ſmote him? in meaſure, when it ſhooteth forth thou wilt debate with him.</hi> As if it had been ſaid, he ſhall have no greater a meaſure than is both uſeful and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; Firſt, to humble him for his ſin; ſecondly, to ſubdue and mortifie his ſin; thirdly, he ſhall have no more than is needful to exerciſe his graces, his faith and patience; no more, fourthly, than is needful to make him thankful for deliverance, and ſenſible of mercy when it comes. Thus, as God, who hath plenty of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, will not afflict us, but when there is need, ſo not more than is need.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It may be ſaid, He will not afflict, becauſe he doth not afflict us more than we can bear; he tenderly conſiders our ſtrength, what we are able to ſtand under, &amp; how long we are able to ſtand under it; he will not break our backs nor our hearts (unleſs by godly ſorrow for, or from ſin) by affliction. <hi>God</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13.) <hi>is faithful, who will not ſuffer you to be tempted above that you are able, but will with the temptation alſo make a way to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, that ye may be able to bear it.</hi> Hence wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="633" facs="tcp:48335:325"/> many his priſoners, yet then his bowels are opened towards them, he will not cruſh, nor tread them down, as mire in the ſtreets. <hi>I</hi> (ſaith the Lord, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.16.) <hi>will not contend for ever,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>Thus we may ſafely underſtand this aſſertion, <hi>He will not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict,</hi> that is, he afflicts not willingly; he afflicts not till there is need, nor will he afflict more than needs, nor more than we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or himſelf will enable us to bear; he will either ſupport us under, or give us deliverance out of all our afflictions in due time.</p>
                  <p>I might hence, or from the whole, infer a double duty.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Be Patient under affliction.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Be Comforted in affliction.</p>
                  <p>For God doth ſo afflict, that he may be truly ſaid not to afflict, But having met with occaſions for the miniſtring of ſuch like coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels to the afflicted, from other paſſages in this book, it may ſuffice only to mind the Reader of them here.</p>
                  <p>This ſpake <hi>Elihu</hi> in the cloſe or peroration of his diſcourſe, to ſtir up <hi>Job</hi> to conſider all the dealings of God with him; he would have him ſit down with theſe four Doctrinal Concluſions upon his heart, that God is <hi>Excellent in Power, and in Judgement, and in plenty of Juſtice, he will not afflict.</hi> Surely he will not afflict more in meaſure, nor longer in time than is need, as <hi>Job</hi> ſeemed in his paſſion, to intimate and charge God, for which he had ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reproofs before.</p>
                  <p>Thus far I have opened theſe words, as they ſtand in our tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation.

                  </p>
                  <p>Take this note from it;
<q>How great ſoever the power of God is, yet he doth not afflict ſinful man according to the greatneſs of his power, nor the utmoſt line of his juſtice.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lord is full of mercy, full of ſparing mercy, he ſpareth his people, <hi>as a man ſpareth his own ſon that ſerveth him (Mal.</hi> 3.17.) And indeed if God ſhould afflict in <hi>plenty,</hi> that is, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of juſtice, what would become of the beſt, of the holieſt of men? Who can withſtand the power of the great God? who can ſtand in judgment before him, if he ſhould <hi>mark iniquities? (Pſal.</hi> 130.3.) Woe to the moſt innocent man alive, if God ſhould mark iniquities, and not forgive iniquities. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it follows in the next or 4th verſe of that Pſalm, <hi>But with thee is forgiveneſs.</hi> As God is moſt bountiful in giving, ſo is he moſt merciful in forgiving. This holds the head of believing and repenting ſinners above water, and keeps them from ſinking into the bottomleſs gulfe of deſpaire, that they have a forgiving God to go unto, and that there is none like him in forgiving
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:48335:326"/> (<hi>Mich.</hi> 7.18.) None forgiving ſo <hi>freely (Iſa.</hi> 42.25.) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Secondly, Some of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors render the latter part of the verſe thus; whereas we ſay, <hi>He is excellent in judgement, and in plenty of juſtice, he will not affl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> 
                     <hi>He will not afflict judgement and plenty of justice;</hi> that is, as they give the gloſs, <hi>Though he be great in power, yet he will not pervert justice.</hi> We may well ſay juſtice is afflicted, when it is perverted; and then juſtice is perverted, when any man is wronged, or when at any time the wronged, or wrongfully afflicted, are not righted and relieved. Thus God will not afflict juſtice. Theſe tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors do not joyn the word <hi>afflict</hi> (as we) to the perſon of man, but to the <hi>juſtice</hi> of God, or the actings of his juſtice. He is great in power, but he will not afflict, he will not oppreſs judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and juſtice. This is doubtleſs a great truth in it ſelf, yet I doubt whether it be the truth intended by <hi>Elihu</hi> in this place. Certainly, God will not do any man wrong, though he hath power enough, all power in his hand, yea, God will do all men right; though he be great in power, yet what affliction ſoever he layeth upon the creature ſhall be no affliction to juſtice or judgement, to that juſtice or judgement with which God is cloathed, and will declare by executing it among the children of men. But I paſs this as over-nice.</p>

And they inſtance in the rules which God gave about offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and ſacrifices; he required (ſay they) of ſome only a turtle dove, or a pair of young pigeons, of others but a lamb, or a bullock, ſuch things he required for ſacrifice as were of eaſie price, and might eaſily be obtained, he did not put us upon the getting of ſtrange and rare beaſts, as Buffes, or Unicorns, or any ſort of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which may put us to much paines in getting them, or to much expenſe in buying them.

This therefore is a
<pb n="637" facs="tcp:48335:327"/> truth, both as to them and us, yet I conceive it beſide the deſign of <hi>Elihu</hi> in this place, and I only mind the Reader of theſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent interpretations, of all which ſome good improvement may be made. So much of this verſe: The whole diſcourſe of <hi>Elihu</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes in the next.</p>

                  <p>This verſe containeth two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, a practical inference, by way of uſe, from that fourfold do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine held forth in the former verſe, concerning God. As if <hi>Elihu</hi> had ſaid, <hi>For as much as the Almighty is incomprehenſible, ſo that we cannot find him out; for as much as he is mighty in power, and judgement, and plenty of juſtice, ſo that we can neither avoid him nor delude him, therefore men do fear him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, We have an enforcement of this Inference, by a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent reaſon, <hi>For he reſpecteth not any that are wiſe in heart.</hi> Who theſe wiſe-hearted ones are, whom God reſpecteth not, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the opening thoſe words,

Yet we need not ſtand ſtrictly upon the Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical ſignification of the word, but may take men, in all their diviſions and formes; men, be they high or low, afflicted or in proſperity, ought therefore to fear him.</p>
                  <p>Only, it may ſeem moſt ſutable, in way of application, to <hi>Job,</hi> for <hi>Elihu</hi> to uſe this word in that reſtrained ſence; <hi>Afflicted feeble men do fear him,</hi> As if he had ſaid. <hi>O Job, thou art a weak man, a man greatly afflicted, thou haſt been long under the rod and chaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning hand of God, therefore thou oughteſt to fear him, and not expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulate the matter with him, as thou haſt done. Men do</hi>
                     <q>Therefore fear him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This illative, <hi>Therefore,</hi> hath reference (as was intimated) to all that was ſaid in the former verſe, yet we may take it ſpecially in
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:48335:328"/> theſe two particulars. <hi>Therefore men do fear him;</hi> Why?</p>

                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Therefore men do fear him;</hi> Why? Becauſe, though he be cloathed with power, juſtice and judgement, yet <hi>he will not afflict,</hi> that is, he will not afflict extreamly, in any of tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Now though it may be ſaid (as it hath often in the opening this Book) that <hi>Job</hi> ſpake ſuch words partly in the heat of his paſſion, partly through the greatneſſe of his pain, partly through the infirmity of his fleſh, as alſo being much moved and provoked by the grievous cenſures of his friends: yet notwithſtanding all this, his words were ſuch as neither could, nor ought to be wholly excuſed; ſo that <hi>Elihu</hi> might ſay, <hi>Men do therefore fear him.</hi> But, <hi>O Job, thou haſt carried it, as if thou didſt not fear him,</hi> thou haſt not behaved thy ſelf like other men, under the ſame, or a like afflicting hand of God. For though <hi>Job</hi> is to be reckoned among men that feared God, yea, in the higheſt form of thoſe that feared him, yet he failed much in his affliction, as to the expreſſion of this holy fear.</p>
                  <p>Thus we have that two-fold reference, in which <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith, <hi>Therefore do men fear him.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe of his great power.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Becauſe of that great tenderneſſe which he uſeth in the exerciſe of his power: Which yet <hi>Job</hi> did ſcarce acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as appeared by his complainings and murmurings about the dealings of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Men do therefore fear him,</hi> ſo we render,<note place="margin">Ideo timebunt eum homines. <hi>Mont.</hi> Verbum futuri temporis ſolet denotari idquod debet, quod ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedit fieri, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re timebunt idem erit, quod timere debent, timere jubentur</note> yet 'tis conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that the Hebrew runs in the future time, <hi>Men will therefore fear him,</hi> that is, <hi>men ſhould therefore fear him,</hi> or men therefore ought to fear him. Words in the Hebrew of a future ſignification, bear the importance of a preſent duty; what good 'tis ſaid men will do, is as if it had been ſaid, they do, or ought to do. And as to the duty here ſpoken of, <hi>the fear of God,</hi> we may make this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, <hi>All good men do fear God upon thoſe accounts, and all men ſhould, or ought to fear him.</hi> The thing is to be done, whether men do it or no. Where an expreſſe command is given, every man concerned is bound to obey; and where, or who is the man that is not concern'd in this command, <hi>fear the great and gracious God? Men do therefore</hi>
                     <q>Fear him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>What it is to fear God, was ſhewed largely at the 28th Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this Book and the laſt Verſe,<note place="margin">Deum vereri, Deum timere.

Tamen hanc differentiam interpretes non obſervant; nam paſſim timere uſurpant pro vereri. <hi>Druſ.</hi>
                     </note> therefore I ſhall not ſtay upon it hear: Only remember the word ſignifieth, a gracious, a child-like fear, not a ſervile flaviſh fear. There are two words, by which the fear of God is expreſſed in the Latine tongue, which we may expreſſe thus, <hi>to fear God,</hi> or, <hi>to be afraid of God.</hi> Good men fear God, but wicked men are afraid of God. Now though the words are often uſed promiſcuouſly, and to fear, is ſometimes taken in the worſer, ſometimes in the better ſence, yet, here we are to take it in the beſt ſence, <hi>Therefore do men fear him,</hi> that is, they ought to ſtand in awe and not ſin againſt him, they ſhould ſubmit to, not diſpute his dealings. The fear of God, in the general noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, is nothing elſe, but Piety and Religion, or the whole worſhip of God. To ſay a man is godly or religious, is all one as to ſay, he is a man fearing God. Now, whereas uſually a general rule is urged to lead in a general practiſe, here a general practiſe is ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged as leading to a general rule. <hi>Men do therefore fear him.</hi>

                  <p>Whence we may take this general Obſervation;
<q>It is the duty of all men, of every man, to fear God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Men, one or other, ought to have high and honourable thoughts of God, they ought to have holy and reverentiall thoughts of God, they ought to put far away from them all ſlightneſs, and vanity of ſpirit, when they think or ſpeak of God, they ought to put far from them all boldneſs and preſumption, when they have to do with God. To put away all flight and bold thoughts of God, to take up high and reverential thoughts of God, this, this is to fear God. Yet a little further, and more diſtinctly, I conceive here in this place, to fear God, ſtands in a four-fold oppoſition.</p>

                  <p>The Lord having ſuch power to do, ſuch wiſdom in doing, ſuch a mixture of mercy with juſtice in all that he doth, men ſhould only admire and improve his doings, not murmure at, nor lightly paſs by, nor queſtion, nor curiouſly pry into what he doth.

                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <p>Secondly, Taking the word <hi>men</hi> more ſtrictly, as ſignifying, not ſtrong, or mighty men, but weak, afflicted men;</p>
                  <p>Note;
<q>When God is afflicting us, we ought to be much in the fear of God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>What? when the hand of God is upon us, ſhall our hearts be lifted up againſt him? or in our ſelves? what! ſhall not our hearts ſtoop when our backs are burdened with ſorrows, and bowed
<pb n="641" facs="tcp:48335:329"/> down with a croſs? Not to fear God when we are at furtheſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from fear, or trouble in the world, is an argument of a very bad heart; but not to fear him when fear is round about us, or, when himſelf is chaſtening and correcting of us, argueth a much worſe frame of heart. Holy <hi>David</hi> gave this character of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.19.) <hi>Becauſe they have no changes, therefore they fear not God.</hi> What ſhall we ſay of them who fear not God though they have many changes? ſuch changes, I mean, as <hi>Job</hi> felt, and cryed out of in the bitterneſs of his ſoul (<hi>Chap.</hi> 10.17.) <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and war are againſt me:</hi> And 'tis conceived, that <hi>Elihu</hi> aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed particularly at <hi>Job</hi> in this paſſage, as if he were the man, who, though under great changes, and in great troubles, ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> behaved himſelf unlike thoſe who truly fear the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Note;
<q>It is ſo much the duty of man to fear God, that it may well be ſuppoſed of all men, that they fear him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He can ſcarce be looked upon as a man, who doth not fear God. Doth he know himſelf to be a weak man, who doth not tremble at the remembrance of the Almighty God? Doth he know himſelf to be a ſinful man who doth not tremble at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the holy, of the moſt holy God? This duty of fear is due to God upon ſo many accounts (even common accounts) from man, that we may conclude, ſurely, every man feareth God. Shall we not fear him who is incomprehenſibly great in power and in judgment, and in plenty of juſtice? What! not fear him who made us, and preſerveth us, who feeds and cloaths us? What! nor fear him in whoſe hand our breath is, and all our wayes? Theſe, and many more, are common accounts, upon which all men may ſee both reaſon and their own engagement to fear God. So then, as becauſe it is ſo much the duty of a Son to honour his Father, and of a Servant to fear his Maſter, therefore the Scripture ſuppoſeth all Sons and Servants doing it (<hi>Mal.</hi> 1.6.) <hi>A Son honoureth his Father, and a Servant his Master.</hi> He doth no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And doubtleſs, if a Son or Servant deſerves not to bear the name of theſe relations, unleſs they honour and fear Father and Maſter, how much leſs do they deſerve to be called Men, who do not fear God, the Almighty God!</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond ground of this fear, is the mercy and goodneſs of God, who though he be thus powerful and juſt, yet he will not afflict, that is, he will not afflict without mercy and tenderneſs to his people.</p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve;
<q>God is to be feared becauſe he is ſo gracious and full of compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, even while he doth afflict.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is mercy with God not to afflict, that's ſparing mercy, and therefore he is to be feared; there is mercy alſo with God in mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating our afflictions, that's ſparing mercy too, and <hi>therefore he is to be feared.</hi> The graciouſneſs of God manifeſted ſomtimes in ſparing to afflict us, and often in afflicting us ſparingly, ſhould move us to fear him both greatly and alwayes: and if ſparing mercy ſhould move us to fear him, then much more ſhould forgiving and pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercy. When the Lord (<hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6, 7.) <hi>Paſſed by before Moſes, and proclaimed, The Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-ſuffering, and abundant in goodneſs and truth, keeping mercy for thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, forgiving iniquity, tranſgreſſion and ſin,</hi> &amp;c. At this procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of grace, <hi>Moſes (verſ.</hi> 8.) <hi>made haste, and bowed his head towards the earth and worſhipped.</hi> How graceleſs then are they, who when they hear that God is gracious, merciful, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant in goodneſs, fear him not, but grow wanton and abuſe his kindneſs!</p>
                  <p>Now they who fear God, upon the due conſideration, either of his power or goodneſs, find their hearts,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Much enlarged in the ſervice of God, or in doing the work, and walking in the wayes of God (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.5.)</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This fear keeps their hearts to a cloſe communion with God (<hi>Jer.</hi> 32.32.) <hi>I will put my fear in their heart, and they ſhall not depart from me.</hi> We uſually not only depart, but run from thoſe whom we fear; but the true fear of God, Covenant-fear makes us cling about, and keep cloſe to him.</p>

<pb n="645" facs="tcp:48335:331"/> Whom then doth he reſpect or regard? of whom will he take notice, if not of the wiſe in heart? Hath the Lord any reſpect for fooles, for ignorant men, for ideots, for ſotts? Surely men that are wiſe in heart, are not only very amiable but honourable in the eyes of God; Why then is it ſaid, <hi>He reſpecteth not any that are wiſe in heart?</hi>

                  <p>Firſt, there are ſome wiſe in heart, who are ſo only in their own opinion, in their own conceits or eyes; they have great thoughts of their own wiſdom, and therefore as they are apt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe men, ſo they are far from the fear of God. There is a wiſdom in ſome men oppoſed to the fear of God, whereas true wiſdome in any man is the beginning of that fear, as that fear is called the <hi>beginning of wiſdom (Pſal.</hi> 111.10.)<note place="margin">Qui ſibi vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentur eſſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pientes. <hi>Vulg.</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, Others are truly wiſe, graciouſly wiſe, wiſe for their ſouls, wiſe for heaven, wiſe for happineſs, ſubmitting their wiſdom to the will of God, and doing his will: They that are thus wiſe in heart, the Lord reſpects, and highly reſpects; how can he do otherwiſe? ſeeing this is the character of God himſelf (<hi>Job.</hi> 9.4.) <hi>He is wiſe in heart, and mighty in ſtrength.</hi> And as God is wiſe in heart, ſo according to their line and meaſure, they that are godly, <hi>are wiſe in heart</hi> too. Therefore taking our tranſlation, the wiſe in heart intended by <hi>Elihu,</hi> muſt needs be thoſe that are only carnally wiſe, politickly wiſe, na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="646" facs="tcp:48335:332"/> And doubtleſs, <hi>Elihu</hi> obſerving that <hi>Job</hi> had ſpoken ſomewhat highly of himſelf, and did not carry it humbly enough under the hand of God (though his ſpirit was broken and brought down at laſt) checks him here, by telling him, <hi>God reſpecteth not any that are wiſe in heart,</hi> no not him, in that caſe and frame of ſpirit, as lifted up in his own wiſdom.</p>
                  <p>Yea, Taking <hi>wiſe in heart,</hi> in this beſt ſence, for the graciouſly wiſe, it is not for their wiſdom and holineſs that God reſpecteth or favoureth them. As he will not chaſtiſe them without cauſe, nor correct them but for their good; ſo when he doth them good or raiſeth them up, when he ſheweth them any favour, or giveth them any mercy, he doth it not for their wiſdom-ſake, or holineſs-ſake, but for his Sons-ſake, or for his own Name-ſake. <hi>Acts of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour from God, are purely from his free grace,</hi> not from any deſert in man; ſo that every way his mercy is from himſelf, and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by us. <hi>He reſpecteth not any that are wiſe in heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, As the <hi>wiſe in heart</hi> ſtand in oppoſition to thoſe that fear God, ſpoken of before, being ſo ſtout that they do not humble themſelves in his fear,</p>
                  <p>Note;
<q>True wiſdom is alwayes joyned with the fear of God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yea, as <hi>Job</hi> concluded (<hi>Chap.</hi> 28.28.) <hi>The fear of the Lord, that is wiſdom, and to depart from evil</hi> (which none do but they who fear the Lord) <hi>is understanding.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Note;
<q>God regardeth no man for his wiſdom, who doth not fear him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let men be never ſo learned and wiſe, never ſo prudent and politick, if they have not the true fear of God before their eyes, he values them not, he will not caſt an eye of favour upon them, they ſhall have no countenance with him, no honour from him. The moſt wiſe, the only wiſe God cares not for the wiſeſt of men, who ſtand ſo much upon their own underſtanding, as to ſtout it out with him. He is not at all moved (unleſs to diſpleaſure) by their wiſdom, who are puffed up with a conceit of their wiſdom.</p>
                  <pb n="647" facs="tcp:48335:332"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, When 'tis ſaid, <hi>He reſpecteth not any that are wiſe in heart,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note;
<q>Wiſdom, without the fear of God, will do no man good at last, nor can it keep him off from evil.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let no man think by his wiſdom, policy, or ſubtilty, to keep him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf out of the reach of God. If men will not fear and honour him, he knoweth well enough how to deal with them, and to recover his honour upon them.</p>
                  <p>Note Fourthly;
<q>Let men be as wiſe and crafty as they will, God is not afraid of them, as if they could do him any hurt, or ſpoil his deſignes, as if they could out-wit him, and over-throw his counſels.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some take upon them, as if they by their wiſedom could hinder Gods purpoſes, and counter-work him, as if they could over-reach or undermine him. We are much afraid of wiſe men; If ſuch a wiſe man, if ſuch <hi>a head-piece,</hi> be againſt us, we think ſurely he will works us a great deal of miſcheife. When <hi>David</hi> found his ſon <hi>Abſalom</hi> rebelling againſt him, and <hi>Achitophel</hi> joyning with him, he prayed that God would <hi>turn his counſell into fooliſhneſs</hi> (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.31.) <hi>David</hi> feared that <hi>Achitophels</hi> going over to <hi>Abſalom,</hi> might have carryed the whole buſineſs againſt him: <hi>But God doth not regard a whole conclave of Achitophels,</hi> he cares not a ſtraw for their plottings and contrivings. The Lord is ſo far from fearing the counſels of the wiſe in heart, that he can deſtroy them by their own wiſdome, and not only undoe their counſels, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe them by their counſels: The pit which they have digged, they ſhall fall into it themſelves, and be entangled in the lime-twiggs which they have ſet up for others. All this the holy Prophet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended when he ſaid of God (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.25.) <hi>He fruſtrateth the tokens of the lyers, and maketh the diviners mad: He turneth wiſe men backward, and maketh their knowledge fooliſh.</hi> Diviners grow mad when they ſee things iſſuing quite contrary to their predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and expectations. He that can deſtroy the wiſe with their own wiſdom, needs not fear the wiſdom of the wiſeſt. 'Tis the nobleſt way of vanquiſhing an enemy, when we wound him with his own weapons, and turn his own Artillery upon him.
<pb n="648" facs="tcp:48335:333"/> Thus God dealeth with the wiſe in heart; they are nothing in his hands, they cannot put the leaſt ſtop to what he hath a purpoſe to do; but he can put a ſtop to all their purpoſes. <hi>The fooliſhneſs of God</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.25.) <hi>is wiſer than men.</hi> He ſaith alſo in the third Chapter of the ſame Epiſtle (<hi>verſ</hi> 19.) <hi>The wiſdome of this world is fooliſhneſs with God;</hi> for it is w i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Again, Taking <hi>the wiſe in heart</hi> for thoſe who are truly wiſe, godly wiſe,</p>
                  <p>Learn, Fifthly;
<q>God will not forbear, when he ſeeth cauſe to afflict thoſe who are indeed the wiſeſt and holieſt of men.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let no man think, that becauſe he is wiſe or holy, he muſt not therefore be touched or medled with. Some conceive the chief deſign of writing this Book, was to let us ſee this truth, That let men be never ſo holy, never ſo upright, or godly, yet they muſt not claime priviledge from the croſs, nor complain when they are under it, that God deals not well with them. In this <hi>Job</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, ſuppoſing there was no cauſe why ſuch a man as he, ſhould have ſuch ſevere chaſtenings and rebukes; but let men be never ſo wiſe, never ſo good, God may ſee cauſe to lay his chaſtening rods upon them; and had the Lord nothing elſe to ſay for it, his ſoveraignty will bear him out in it againſt the beſt of men. The clay muſt neither ſay to the Potter, why haſt thou made me ſo? nor why haſt thou marr'd me ſo? <hi>Be ſilent O all fleſh</hi> (good as well as bad) <hi>before the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="649" facs="tcp:48335:333"/>
                  <p>Laſtly, Obſerve;
<q>What-ever favour, what-ever mercy God beſtoweth upon the holiest and wiſest of men, he doth it not with reſpect to any wiſdome, holineſs, or goodneſs in them, but for his own Name ſake, or becauſe he will.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He reſpecteth not the wiſe in heart.</hi> No man can merit the leaſt favour from God; his is free grace. All good cometh to us through the Son of his love, and it was meerly of his love, that ever his Son came to us and dyed for us. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us not ſay, ſuch a one was a good man, ſuch a one was an holy man, therefore it was ſo and ſo with him. As what we are or can do cannot oblige him (when he ſees cauſe) from giving us correction, ſo he is un-obliged as to what we are or can do, in giving us ſalvation, whether temporal or eternal. <hi>He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecteth not the wiſe in heart.</hi>

The truth is, all men naturally are no better (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.2.) <hi>The Lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to ſee if there were any that did underſtand and ſeek God;</hi> but he did not find one wiſe in heart among all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men, as Deſcendants from the firſt <hi>Adam.</hi> And when he cometh among the beſt of men, men of a ſecond birth, the ſeed and deſcendants of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> he doth not ſee them ſo wiſe as to give him glory in every condition, nor under every diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, yea, he finds a great deal of folly in their hearts.
